            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not vnknowen to your Honor, how the aduerſaries haue neuer ceaſed ſince the beginning of hir Maieſties moſte hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie reigne vntil this day, by their bookes in great numbers written and publiſhed, and by al other means, that poſsiblie they might deuiſe, to trouble the ſtate of the Church, and to diffame that holy religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, which through Gods great
<pb facs="tcp:27710:3"/>mercie, and godlie lawes of our gratious Souereign, is according to his holy word eſtabliſhed amongſt vs. VVhat they haue wrought with manie of al eſtates, and how mightelie they haue preuailed with that ſtrong &amp; effectual illuſion of Satan, which hath aduaunced Antichriſt vnto that ſupremacie of power, authoritie, and credit in the world, wherof the holy ghoſt by <hi>SS. Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> hath foretold, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable experience can witnes in the backſliding, and continuall falling of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie away from vs, to their own final per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to the grief of the godlie, &amp; to the great encouragement and comfort of the enemie. And among other examples of this Apoſtaſie, I offer to your Honor one verie notable, euen the man with whom I haue in this booke to deale, who hauing bene late not onlie a common profeſſor of our religion, but a publick miniſter and
<pb facs="tcp:27710:3"/>preacher of the ſame in our Church, hath not onlie reuolted from vs, through ſome worldly tentations, and run ouer into our enemies ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p, but hath alſo lifted vp his heel againſt vs, and in open writing moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſly and bitterly railed at vs. Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vttering his conceiued malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, in his late writing he taketh by a certein Preface of mine before the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to D. <hi>Saunders</hi> demonſtrations of Antichrist, which being not verie long, and handling no great variety of matter, I neuer thoght could haue prouoked the Aduerſarie ſo much, or procured ſo long and large a Confutation. I looked rather that the ſubſtance of my book concerning Antichriſt, ſhould haue bin anſwered by ſome that would maintein <hi>Sau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherby he laboreth to prooue that the Pope cannot be Antichriſt; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in deed a weighty and moſte materiall
<pb facs="tcp:27710:4"/>controuerſie, required the learning and diligence of the moſte ſufficient ſcholler amongſt them. Neither coulde I other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſuspect, but ſeeing I had written in latin againſt a latin Aduerſarie, he who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhould take in hand to ſet forth anie thing againſt me, would haue done it in the latin tongue. But M. <hi>Rainolds,</hi> who was appointed (as he ſaith) to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere my booke of Antichriſt, and in all his actions profeſſeth himſelf to be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by thoſe, to whoſe gouernment he hath ſubmitted himſelfe, pretending in ſhew to publiſh a confutation thereof, hath written onely againſt the preface, wherin are handled other matters, &amp; ſo hath anſwered nothing to the principall queſtion, wherof the book, that he would ſeeme to haue confuted, ſpeciallie entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: &amp; further hath written not in latin as I did, but in engliſh, as liked beſt his
<pb facs="tcp:27710:4"/>gouernors &amp; himſelf. VVherupon I was at the firſt partlie perſuaded to paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this Refutation of his with ſilence: &amp; the rather, becauſe I liſted not to reaſon or deale againſt ſuch a one as he is, of whom for manie reſpects I could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue anie hope at al, that euer my labors ſhould doe him good, hauing thus embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced pernitious &amp; deceitful error, &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie caſt awaie from him the loue of the truth, which once he had in ſhew recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which he pretended to beleeue, and which he did in deed profes. Which kind of men through Gods iuſtice for the moſt part are giuen ouer into ſuch reprobate hardnes of hart, that they can neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be reclaimed, but continue alwaies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate to their euerlaſting deſtruction. Notwithſtanding, when I peruſed better the contents of his booke, and tooke aduiſe of the godlie, what were beſt for me to do
<pb facs="tcp:27710:5"/>herein, whether I ſhould make anſwer to this man, or rather obeying king <hi>Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> commandement, let him alone, and ſay nothing to him, I was in the end reſolued to ſet forth a plain and ſufficient anſwer to his whole volume, not for his ſake, of whom I haue no hope, nor reſpect, but in regard of others, who thereby maie ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be confirmed in the truth, or preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from error.</p>
            <p>I ſee the Aduerſaries drift eſpeciallie was, to breed in the minds of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen a miſliking of this our religion, which himſelf hauing once liked wel, was after (I know not how) moued to miſlike. The which he endeuoreth to performe by ſome other means, then heertofore haue commonlie bene vſed, as anie man reading his book may ſoon obſerue, wherin he ſhal finde continual allegations of teſtimonies out of our owne writers, craftely brought
<pb facs="tcp:27710:5"/>in, to ſhew a diſſenſion of iudgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our ſelues, that ſo his readers may be induced to thinke the worſe of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and of vs al. A deuiſe ful of fraud, diſhoneſtie &amp; malice, to take aduantage of mens infirmities &amp; imperfections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the eternal truth of God, which he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not by ordinarie &amp; lawful kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning refute. Betweene <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> about the Sacrament, was a ſharp contention, hotlie debated in manie books, &amp; the ſame hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued ſince to the great hindrance of the goſpell and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of many. In which contrary writings and diſcourſes, are found oftentimes har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſpeeches of either againſt other, then were to be wiſhed, yet ſuch as the godlie ſeruants of the Lord in contention about the truth, ſomtimes ar moued to vtter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their brethren. S. <hi>Paul</hi> openlie and ſharply reprehended S. <hi>Peter</hi> to his face,
<pb facs="tcp:27710:6"/>whereat wicked <hi>Porphyrie</hi> catched a like occaſion to raile at Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion long ſince, as our aduerſaries do at theſe daies. VVhat a violent and troubleſome contention was there betweene <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and good <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople?</hi> VVho knoweth not how ſharplie <hi>Cyrillus</hi> a learned and wiſe Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> hath written againſt <hi>Theodoritus</hi> a godlie and catholick Biſhop, in a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie touching the catholick faith? Both Biſhops, both catholickes, both learned, both godly, both excellent pillers of the Church: and yet he that readeth both their writinges, would thinke that both were daungerous enemies of the Church and faith of Chriſt, and of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be auoyded. So in the bookes of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and thoſe that maintaine either part, appeereth (I
<pb facs="tcp:27710:6"/>graunt) great ſharpneſse and bitterneſſe of diſſenſion: who all notwithſtanding, if ye ſet the heat of diſputation aſide, were as godlie, as learned, as zealous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as the worlde had anie. Nowe commeth in M. <hi>Rainoldes</hi> like a craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie enemie, and gathering a heape of ſuch ſpeeches, out of ſundry their bookes, hath in diuers places of his confutation inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame, as anie occaſion woulde ſerue, to make his readers acquainted therewith, that ſeeing ſuch earneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention among the chiefeſt profeſsors of the Goſpell, they may be further with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn in alienation of minde from the loue and liking thereof. VVherein alſo to helpe his purpoſe, he hath vſed two kindes eſpecially of vnlawfull ſleightes. One is, to report among others the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies alſo of open Aduerſaries to the doctrine of the Goſpel, as namely of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel
<pb facs="tcp:27710:7"/>Fabritius</hi> againſt <hi>Beza,</hi> and of <hi>Caſtalion,</hi> and ſuch others, as eyther being profeſſed papiſtes, or doubtful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes, ought not in this caſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. Another is, to falſifie the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and ſentences of our writers, and ſo to make moſte vntrue reports of them. As for example, in his <hi>12.</hi> cha. pa. <hi>356.</hi> he affirmeth, that we begin ſecretlie to diſprooue the Churches faith, touching the manner of Chriſts crucifying, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that his handes and feet were pearſed with nailes, and for proofe hereof alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth teſtimonies out of <hi>Marlorate, Muſculus</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> in whom no ſuch thing is in anie place to be found. And that euery man maie perceiue what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he hath, &amp; what libertie he taketh to himſelf of ſpeaking and reporting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing vntruly, he accuſeth <hi>Caſtalion</hi> to haue made a diſcourſe in the Preface
<pb facs="tcp:27710:7"/>written to K. <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, before his tranſlation of the Bible, in proofe that Chriſt is not the true Meſsias; which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie is a foule ſlander, as any man maie iudge that readeth the ſame: ſo be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs with the abhominable hereſies of the <hi>Trinitarians, Libertines, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Antinomi, Dauid George,</hi> and ſuch like, whom we deteſt as much as they, againſt whom both wee haue written more then they, and our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, both eccleſiaſticall and ciuil, haue alſo ſeriouſlie proceded. VVith ſuch alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of al ſorts, out of al writers, for al purpoſes, hath he fraughted and ſtuffed his book: other ſubſtance and waight of matter is there none therin, ſo that of it ſelf it might be thought moſte vnworthie of anſwer. Yet becauſe ſuch bookes doe harm abroad, and it is expedient to haue the aduerſaries folly and weaknes dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb facs="tcp:27710:8"/>I haue vndertaken this labour of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering M. <hi>Rainolds,</hi> and that in eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, for the ſame conſideration that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to leaue the latin, and write in the engliſh tongue: which I thinke he hath not done, ſo much for want of skil therin, as that his writings might commonlie be read and vnderſtoode of engliſhmen. This my labour I offer to your Honors good acceptation, humblie beſeeching you, that I may publiſh it vnder the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of your honourable protection.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by his gouernours to make this anſwere,<note place="margin">pag 3.</note> as he ſaith, or els of his owne accord tooke the matter in hande without commiſſion of any ſuperior au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, I take it to be a thing of ſmall regard, both in reſpect of himſelfe, and of his worke, and alſo of thoſe his ſuperiours, to whoſe direction he profeſſeth to haue committed himſelfe, and all the giftes he hath. Onelie this thing I cannot beleeue., although it be no more materiall, then the other, that he was ſo loth to take vpon him this buiſines, as he pretendeth. For if we conſider not onelie the manner of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, wherein appeereth as great malice againſt the trueth of God, as ſhameles railing at Chriſts goſpell, and profeſſors thereof, as notable pride, preſumption, and hardnes of hart, as euer hath done in anie enemie heretofore; but further alſo how neceſſarie it was for him, being a Renegate, and of a Miniſter and Paſtor of a Church become
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:27710:10"/>ſodenlie a ſeminarie Prieſt, &amp; therefore liuing in great ſuſpicion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mongſt his fellowes, to approoue by ſome publike teſtimony his vnfeigned conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to their ſynagogue, we ſhall not eaſilie be perſuaded to thinke there was in the man ſuch vnwillingnes in this matter at the firſt, as he would haue vs to ſuppoſe. But as vaine decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are commonlie wont to excuſe themſelues with pretenſe of being loth to attempt ſo waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a matter, that they maie ſeeme ſomewhat vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to doe the thing, which in truth they doe moſte willinglie and ſtudiouſlie, ſo <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> could not deuiſe a more commodious beginning of his declamatorie preface, then a proteſtation of lothnes to write that, which anie man maie caſilie iudge he went about with all his will, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie, and habilitie.</p>
            <p>And that you maie the rather imagine he was forſooth verie lothe to take this matter in hand, he can ſhew you diuerſe reaſons, that made him ſo loth: and yet the true reaſon, that ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede to haue hindred his courſe, he toucheth not, that herein he was to ſet himſelfe againſt the knowen truth, to write againſt his conſcience in open maintenance of wicked hereſies, to fight for Antichriſt againſt the Lord, and finallie to commit the ſinne, that either in propertie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the greateſt of all, or commeth neereſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. One reaſon was, he ſaith, becauſe he ſawe manie in that ſocietie, <hi>as willing and more hable to vndertake, and diſpatch a greater matter then that.</hi> As willing <hi>Maſter Rainolds?</hi> whie? then haue you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled before in telling vs you were vnwilling: now by your owne confeſſion you were willing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27710:10"/>enough, but there were manie alſo in your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as willing as you. Whereof ſurelie we haue no doubt, that you are all moſte wilfullie bent, and earneſtlie diſpoſed to doe what harme anie of you poſſiblie can to the Church of England. As for your knowledge and habilitie to performe againſt vs anie notable enterpriſe, we haue no care, we ſtand in no feare of you, we knowe what pith is in the ſtrongeſt of you. And for your ſelfe, <hi>Maſter Rainolds,</hi> I am of opinion, that you maie truelie take the garland from your owne head, and giue it rather to manie others of your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon he faineth to be,<note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> for that he <hi>thought it ſome iniurie to Catholikes to diſpute againſt that ſauage and barbarous paradoxe,</hi> namelie that the Pope is Antichriſt. What iniurie could this be thought done to your Catholikes, <hi>Maſter Rainolds,</hi> to write in defenſe of your Pope, and prooue him not to be that Antichriſt, then which a greater pleaſure can no man doe for him, and for his Church, it being apparant, and ſo of manie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians beleeued, that he is indeed no other, then the verie Antichriſt himſelfe? In which reſpect perhaps your conſcience tolde you, that if you oppoſed your ſelfe againſt this trueth, therein ſhould you offer iniurie to your Pope, and Pope-catholike brethren, whome the ſame ſo ſpecially doth concerne.</p>
            <p>You ſaie I know not what Antichriſt is,<note place="margin">Contrae Sander. pa. <hi>6.</hi> in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio.</note> againſt whome I write, and that ſometime I <hi>make Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt to be the wholl Catholike and vniuerſall Church, wherof the Pope is head:</hi> which to be a pregnant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth, he that looketh one the place, may ſee.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27710:11"/>Haue I ſaied, the Pope is head of the Chatholike vniuerſall Church? or the Catholike vniuerſall Church is Antichriſt? what will you be aſhamed hereafter to write, that in the firſt entrance write thus vntruelie without ſhame? and yet hauing your ſelfe auouched ſo notorious an vntruth, you dare make mention of <hi>Lucians</hi> true hiſtorie, which booke, as may ſeeme, you haue not onelie read ouer with diligence and delight, but alſo tranſlated into Engliſh, &amp; propounded vnto your ſelfe as worthie of your imitaion. For to giue you that praiſe, that of due belongeth vnto you, <hi>Lucian,</hi> if he liued, could hardlie coyne more paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vntruthes, or ſcoffe more kindelie at Chriſt and his goſpell, then you haue done.</p>
            <p>A greater reaſon was, he ſaith, for that he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred to deale with heretiks,<note place="margin">pag. 5.</note> who paſſe al other in pride and ignorance, and of all heretikes, he maketh vs of England to be the worſt. Indeede true it is that heretikes for the moſt part are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate &amp; paſt amendment, &amp; therefore a great wearines &amp; vexation of minde is it to maintaine contentions, and diſputes with them, whereof in the end ſmall profit doth redound. But this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of hereticall wilfulnes nothing toucheth vs, who by Gods grace are far from al kinde of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and hold no other doctrine then that which the Prophets and Apoſtles, and Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe haue taught vs, &amp; which is plainly contained in the bookes of canonicall ſcripture, from which if labouring to diſſwade vs you cannot preuaile, no maruell is it. And in defending the ſame, we are content to be eſteemed of you contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, proude, ignorant, and as you liſt. We are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:27710:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>not ſo much in loue of your ſociety, nor ſeeke your fauour and commendation ſo greatlie, that we will ioine in vnitie with you againſt the Lord, his trueth, and Church. If you thinke we are proud, tell vs wherein our pride conſiſteth. If in that we will not yeald vnto you, nor giue ouer mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Goſpell, pardon vs, <hi>Maſter Rainolds:</hi> modeſtie in the Lord is an excellent vertue, but the modeſtie that betraieth the trueth of God is accurſed. Other pride (I doubt not) we are as cleare from, as your ſelfe or anie of your fellowes. And for ignorance, we may thinke it was ſome ſpice of pride in you to obiect it vnto vs, who for anie thing that appeereth haue no cauſe to brag of ſuch knowledge, or to chalenge more to your ſelfe, then you may ſafely graunt to an other. For tell vs what learning is, wherein it conſiſteth, and howe it maie be gotten? Vnles you haue ſome ſpeciall meanes, and as it were ſome ſecret waie to attaine vnto it, which others haue not, I ſee not why we ſhould thinke that you haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a greater meaſure of learning and wiſdome, then others who haue vſed as great indeauour as your ſelfe. And what the matter ſhould be, I know not, that you are ſodenlie become ſo learned and that we haue loſt all learning. But were you as learned as euer anie was, or could be, your learning ſhall not be hable to hurte the cauſe, that we defend: your learning ſhall in the end deceiue you: and you that now boaſte of your knowledge, ſhall then be aſhamed of your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. To knowe Chriſt out of his worde, is true knowledge, ſound learning, and perfect wiſdome.</p>
            <p>Certaine examples you rehearſe of our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27710:12"/>aſſertions, onelie thereby to make our cauſe ſeeme odious to the ſimple: but the reaſons of our aſſertions you pretermit, which is your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſleight, continuallie to tell your readers that ſuch and ſuch opinions we holde, and not to ſhew the maner, nor to remember or anſwere our reaſons. Wherein I deſire the reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how vntruelie <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> hath char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me with a wicked hereſie, that in this man he maie beholde the conſcience of a Papiſt. He ſetteth downe for one of my ſayings, that <hi>Chriſt is not begotten of the ſubſtance of his father:</hi> a ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der moſte manifeſt, in a matter of greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I haue not writen thus, no, I neuer thought thus. I abhorre with my hart all ſuch blaſphemy againſt the Perſon of our ſauiour Chriſt. But in the meane time what hath this ſlaunderer deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? Let the reader equallie iudge betweene him and me, and by triall hereof eſteeme more indifferentlie of the reſt of his malice.</p>
            <p>Now the greateſt cauſe of all that made him ſo loth,<note place="margin">pag. 7.</note> was, he ſaith, becauſe he found in our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine no ſtaie or certentie, which yet, if it were true, ſhould haue miniſtred vnto him greater will and courage, forſomuch as the doctrine that ſtandeth vpon no certaine ſtaie is eaſilie diſproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and ouerthrowen. But in trueth <hi>Maſter Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> perceiuing our doctrine to be grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles which maie not be remooued, and knowing we will not yeald to mens doctrines and inuentions whatſoeuer, differing from the holie ſcriptures, but reſt our ſelues whollie vpon the written word of God, I thinke he was indeede ſomewhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:27710:12"/>as great cauſe was he ſhould, being ſure his engines could not preuaile againſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>And what greater ſteadfaſtnes in religion can be required, then to holde Gods word, which we profeſſe to be the ground, whereon we build our faith? If you can ſhewe, wherein we ſwarue from it, we will not refuſe your inſtruction. But ſaie not nowe we are vnſtaied, when as you knowe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie our ſelues whollie vpon the worde, vnles you will denie Gods word to be a certaine rule and ſtaie of doctrine. We plant not our religion in mans iudgement &amp; vncertentie of Traditions, in vaine ceremonies and deuiſes, as you doe, but in matters of faith and religion we depend vpon God, whoe in the ſcriptures of the olde and new Teſtament hath deliuered to his Church one cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine, vniforme, and perfect doctrine, to which we adde nothing, from which we take nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, in which we ſettle and ground our ſelues. But let vs heare how <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> can prooue, that the Proteſtants haue no certaine faith. For this he hath propounded to himſelfe to declare eſpeciallie in this preface. And I deſire the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie readers to marke his proofes, which ſhallbe I truſt to their comfort, and confirmation in the truth.</p>

Wherefore this is not ſo to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as though whoſoeuer is baptized, ſhall therefore be ſure to haue eternall life. For <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was baptized, and yet condemned: and ſo alſo manie moe beſides notwithſtanding their baptiſme, ſhalbe excluded from fellowſhip with the Saints in Gods kingdome. So that to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized proueth not neceſſarilie aſſurance and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentie of life euerlaſting in all perſons. Why then might not the Doctors be bolde to ſaie, that baptiſme of it ſelfe hath not this force to make anie the childe of God, &amp; that in baptiſme none can be made the children of God, if they be not his children by election? For doubtles he that commeth to be baprized, vnles he be one of Gods elect, can not in baptiſme receaue the gift of adoption, which onely belongeth to thoſe that are predeſtinate and elect: and election is not begone in baptiſme, but was before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world.</p>

Yea if in our communion booke alteration hath bene, according as to the Church ſeemed moſte conuenient, yet that was not in ſubſtance of Doctrine, but in matters of ceremonie, neither can you charge vs more for changing our communion booke, then we can you for changing and reforming your Miſſales, your Portaſſes, your Breuiaries, &amp; a number ſuch other bookes, euen of late yeares, in dailie and publike vſe of ſeruice amongſt you As for Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſtes, Atheiſtes, Puritanes, the familie of loue, our Church and Religion vtterly condemneth to the pit of hell: and if there be ſuch amongſt vs ſecretlie, ſo haue there alwaies bene heretikes &amp; wicked perſons in the Church, and in reſpect of them our Religion is no more to be accuſed, then the good corne may iuſtlie be condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe together with it manie tares and weeds ſpring vp, and cannot be auoided.</p>

Firſt the ſcripture muſt not be ſcripture in any other ſenſe, then as the Pope will expound it: ſo that the ſcripture being the meaning of the ſcripture, and the meaning of the ſcripture being the Popes expoſition, hereof it followeth that the ſcripture is nothing els but the Popes interpretation. So likewiſe in Traditions, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Councels, Churches, if any thing diſſent from the Popes vnderſtanding and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is reiected, aboliſhed, condemned, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally all faith, all religion, all Diuinitie of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts is onelie the Popes ſacred will and pleaſure. Now then this being their owne certaine reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I would gladlie be enformed, how by the ſame a man may be aſſured of any faith, it being

And if the Pope be obſtinate, and teaching hereſie, and therewith infecting the world, will notwithſtanding ſtoutly ſtand in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe of his doctrine, and will keepe his chaire, what ſhift haue you then, or what can you doe againſt him, ſeing he is your Pope, your head, your author and founder of all your faith?

Thinke not (good reader) that herein I haue ſpoken raſhly without reaſon, I know what I ſpeake, and thy ſelfe conſidering the matter aduiſedlie wilt ſaie as much. For in making an olde rotten tranſlation, (as I may boldlie call it, being compared with the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall word of ſcripture, although otherwiſe I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:27710:22"/>giue to it that reuerence, that the antiquity ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of deſerueth) full of wants, faultes, errors, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſightes, imperfections, and corruptions of all ſortes, as in this booke hereafter (god willing) thou ſhalt perceaue, to be the authenticall word of God, and denying the originall faithfull text, which <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, the Apoſtles, the Euangeliſts did write, to be the worde of God, what do they els but plainlie as it were with one daſh of a penne cancel the wholl ſciptures?

And although <hi>Sanders</hi> hath taken great paines in this behalfe to prooue their Pope to be no Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt (for then all were vtterlie loſt) yet how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle he hath by his demonſtrations preuailed, the godlie reader maie eaſilie iudge by the anſwere ſet forth, which <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not orderlie and thorowlie diſprooue, carpeth at ſome partes thereof in the reſidue of this his preface. But being appointed, as he ſaith, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the booke, it had bene more for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and credite of the cauſe, to haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie refuted my wholl replie, then thus to pike certaine parcels at his owne choiſe, and to pretermit all the reſt.

            <p>In the firſt demonſtration of all,<note place="margin">Pag. 44. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>D. Saunders</hi> endeuoureth to proue, that the great Antichriſt muſt be one ſingular man (for proofe whereof he allegeth ſundrie reaſons, which are ſeuerallie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered) and laſtlie, as the chiefeſt, that all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue ſpoken of Antichriſt, as of one man. <hi>Doctor Saunders,</hi> and parcel of my anſwere are here by <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> repeated, but the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ground thereof is omitted. Whereas it is by <hi>Saunders</hi> affirmed, that all the fathers haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Antichriſt, as of one onelie man: although this be vntrue, and can neuer by <hi>Saunders</hi> or anie Papiſt be prooued; and although further it is one thing to ſpeake of Antichriſt, as of one man, and plainlie to ſaie, that Antichriſt is one man: yet
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:27710:23"/>ſuppoſing this were true, that <hi>Saunders</hi> meaneth, notwithſtanding his demonſtration holdeth not, being taken from the authoritie of men, from whome no demonſtration in diuinitie can be drawen. This is the ſumme of this anſwere which <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> accuſeth of Antichriſtian arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, ſeing the fathers write according to the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall faith and tradition, as he ſaith. But how may it appeere, <hi>Maſter Rainolds,</hi> that the Apoſtles taught or deliuered ſuch a faith vnto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches concerning Antichriſt? if this faith be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in their writings, tell vs in what booke, in what place, in what wordes. If in ſecret tradition, we admit no profe (as you know) from ſuch vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and blinde traditions. And if you your ſelues oftentimes doe diſſent from the fathers, giue vs alſo the ſame libertie of diſſenting from them vpon as good ground and iuſt cauſes as you haue anie. The fathers ſpeake diuerſe times not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tradition &amp; faith Apoſtolicall, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common receiued opinion, them ſelues in plain termes confeſſing that they ſpeake but coniecturally: &amp; if there was not in that age ſo full and cleare knowledge of Antichriſt, as at this daie, no maruell maie it ſeeme to wiſe men, for ſo much as nowe Antichriſt is not onelie borne and bredde, but growne to a ſtrong man, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie diſcerned and acknowledged, by all marks eſſentiall to be Antichriſt. They forſawe him, we ſee him: they knew he ſhould come, we know he is come: they feared him, we haue felt him: they geaſſed at him, we can point him out with our finger: finallie they might be deceiued, but wee cannot, vnles we will ſtop our eares, and cloſe our
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:27710:23"/>eies, and ſuffer our ſelues willinglie to be abuſed.<note place="margin">pag. 46. &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond demonſtration <hi>Doctor Saunders</hi> commendeth the Church of Rome by teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of writers, auncient and later; thereby to make vs beleeue, that ſeing it hath bene ſo highlie praiſed, it cannot therefore poſſiblie be the ſeate of Antichriſt. Here I gaue <hi>Doctor Saunders</hi> a diſtinction betwene the elder Romane Church and the yonger. The auncient Church of Rome indeede was worthelie extolled and magnified of the fathers for conſtant keeping of the faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though euen then in that Church the egge was laide, whereof ſhortlie after Antichriſt was hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: the diſtinction <hi>M. R.</hi> raileth at with all his mighte, but cannot diſprooue with all his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it being euident in al hiſtories, that after the daies of thoſe godly fathers the Biſhop of Rome was made head of the vniuerſal Church, wherein he was publikely proclaimed to be the Antichriſt, that ſhould come: &amp; afterward continually both religion, learning, and good life died by litle and litle in that Church, as hath bene teſtified and complained of by infinite writers. So the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene that Church in former &amp; latter time is no leſſe euident, then betweene a mans youth and doting age, if you conſider all partes and properties of a true Church. And yet, ſaith <hi>Maſter Rainolds,</hi> if it be lawfull thus to anſwere. then ſhall no hereſie euer be repreſſed, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fowlie, that hereſie muſt be refuted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by ſcripture, which neuer changeth, but abideth for euer, though Churches varie both from others, and from themſelues.</p>
            <p>In the third demonſtration,<note place="margin">Pag. 50. &amp;c.</note> wherein <hi>Saunders</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:27710:24"/>affirmeth the ſucceſſion of prieſts in the Romane Church, to be the rocke againſt which the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile, I denie the outwarde chaire or ſucceſſion of biſhops to be the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable &amp; inuincible Rocke, wheron the Church is builded; which is the ſonne of God himſelfe, the onelie foundation of the Church. For out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſucceſſion is no more certaine in that Church, then in others; and it hath bene diuerſe times broken of and diſcontinued by vacations and ſchiſmes for manie yeares together. If then the Church had bene builded vpon this totte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rocke of externall ſucceſſion, at Rome, it had oftentimes bene daſhed and ouerthrowen: but thankes be to God, the Church is builded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſurer rocke, then is the perſonall ſucceſſion of your Popes, or els of anie eſtate of men in the worlde: and therefore, whatſoeuer becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of your Pope or of his chaire and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Church falleth not, but abideth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for euer. Your ſtories written in time of Antichriſtes tyrannie, what cauſe is there whie we ſhould anie whit regarde them, the authors thereof being infected with the errors of the Pope, and daring not write for the moſte parte otherwiſe then might well ſtand with his humor? And to all hiſtories, that ſince the defection haue commended the faith of that Church, we oppoſe the worde of God, which plainelie conuinceth it of manifold and damnable hereſies, beſides we could alledge ſundrie writers in all ages, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlie haue reprooued the ſame.</p>
            <p>The former diſtinction concerning the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church,<note place="margin">pag. 25.</note> here <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> taketh in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:27710:24"/>hand to diſprooue, and to ſhewe, that my para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox (as he calleth it) is impoſſible. Firſt he ſaith I graunted the Church of Rome to haue bene pure, godlie, Chriſtian, for ſixe hundred yeares after Chriſt, which forſooth I neuer graunted (as he meaneth) that ſimply and abſolutelie no manner of corruption in anie parte of doctrine had taken place therin: but onelie according to the ſtate of thoſe times, and compariſon of that general apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie which afterward enſued. So your conceit <hi>M. R.</hi> that this alteration ſhould whollie be wrought within the ſpace often or twelue years, is ſo vaine &amp; childiſh, that nothing can be deuiſed more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and farther of from the purpoſe. No, <hi>M. Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi> notwithſtanding Antichriſt was not openlie aduanced in the Romane Church before <hi>Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> the third, yet was there in it no ſmall prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for entertayning of him before that time through corruption of doctrine and manners in that Church: &amp; though it was in manie things corrupted before, yet had it alſo great ſinceritie, which by little and little decaied more and more till Antichriſt came, and was reuealed: and after Antichriſt was ſeated there, yet was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all puritie loſt by and by, but in continuance of time it fainted and languiſhed, hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued deadlie poiſon, and no remedie being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided. Wherefore this roye of yours, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a vanitie of vanities fitte for ſuch a vaine ſophiſter as you are.</p>
            <p>But now becauſe <hi>Doctor Saunders</hi> and <hi>M. Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> boldelie affirme that by teſtimonies of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries no hereſie was brought into the Romane Church, or anie chaunge of doctrine euer made

            <p>This hereſie hath euer ſince continued in that See, and is at this daie, by the Pope and his Popelings auouched: and therefore by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their owne Hiſtoriographers,<note place="margin">Pag. 55.</note> ſome here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie hath taken place in the Church of Rome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to <hi>Doctor Saunders,</hi> and <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> proude aſſertion.</p>

That I haue ſaid the firſt Romane Church helde the purity of faith, nothing concerneth the later Church; &amp; in what ſenſe I haue ſo ſaide, is before declared: not thereby to iuſtifie that Church in euerie particular doctrine, cuſtome, or ceremonie, but onelie that the principall and ſubſtantiall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Chriſtian religion were in it maintained againſt the heretikes of thoſe times.

And therefore the concluſion that of theſe premiſes ſhould enſue, is like the vntimelie fruite, that ere it be ripe falleth downe to the ground.</p>
            <p>And as for the common place that followeth concerning the continuance of Chriſts vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church,<note place="margin">pag. 57.</note> to what purpoſe doth it ſerue or what argument maie it afforde you? we beleeue and confeſſe to the comforte of our ſoules, that Chriſts Church hath continued, and neuer ſhall faile ſo long as the worlde endureth, and we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a profane hereſie, to teach that Chriſts Catholike vniuerſal Church hath periſhed from the earth at anie time. For this aſſertion (as you truelie prooue) ſhaketh the foundations of all faith and religion. But as you haue effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and inuinciblie by manifolde ſcriptures euin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that Chriſts Church can neuer be rooted out, and no man in the world can open his mouth againſt you herein, ſo if you had alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by like euidence of ſcripture that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vniuerſall Church of Chriſt is nothing els but the outwarde ſucceſſion of the Romane ſee, then had you prooued your matters ſoundlie, and confuted our opinion truelie, and proceeded orderlie. But hauing ſpoken much concerning the perpetuitie of Chriſts Church, which no Chriſtian can denie or doubt of, you bring vs no text not reaſon to ſhew that Chriſts Church either is the Popes ſucceſſion, or els dependeth vpon the ſame. For as touching externall ſhew
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:27710:26"/>and ſucceſſion of Churches the ſcriptures haue foretolde, that Antichriſt ſhall ſeduce great and ſmall,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.61. &amp; 13.16.</note> rich and poore, free and bonde, and that the Church ſhall flie into the wildernes, and there remaine, of al which no word could be true, if the Catholike Church were tied to the Popes Chaire, and the Popes Chaire were the rocke that can not be remooued. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this generall diſperſion and flight of the Church vnder Antichriſt, the Catholike Church ſhall for all that continue, although not in that outwarde ſtrength and glorie, in which ſometimes it hath appeered and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</p>
            <p>Now this long diſcourſe following, is viſible,<note place="margin">Pag. 59. &amp;c.</note> and the Teſtimonies of <hi>Melancthon, Oecolampadius, Caluine,</hi> and <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> at large rehearſed to that purpoſe; all this argueth nothing els, but pitifull and groſſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in this man, who not knowing what he auoucheth, or what he refelleth, yet laieth on ſuch loade, as though with euerie blow he felled his aduerſarie to the ground. The militant Church of Chriſt to be a viſihle companie, who hath from the beginning of the world denied? or who could euer otherwiſe imagine, but that men, whoſoeuer they be, are viſible and maie be diſcerned? This therfore required not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie proofes as you haue brought, being liberall where no neede is: neither in this reſpect do we meane that there is an inuiſible Church, by which we vnderſtand the elect, the faithfull, the members of Chriſtes myſticall bodie: who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they maie be ſeene outwardlie, in that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:27710:26"/>they are men, yet their election, their faith, their ſpirituall adoption and coniunction with Chriſt, in which reſpect they are truelie his Church, can not by outward ſenſe be perceiued. The number of profeſſors is viſible, but the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the elect is not viſible, that is, can not by ſight and ſenſe be tried, diſcerned, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all others. This is the meaning of that diſtinction, which you ought to haue knowen before you laboured to diſprooue it. But if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon you to refute a thing, whereof you are ignorant, you faile ſhamefullie, and make your ſelfe verie ridiculous to your reader, it is no maruell, and you can blame no other then your owne ſelfe.</p>
            <p>For what conceite was this that you haue nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in your braine,<note place="margin">Pag. 64.</note> and vttered in this booke, that we ſhould make the Church of Chriſt to be inuiſible in ſuch ſorte, as you maintaine the bodie of Chriſt to be inuiſiblie in the Sacrament, and hereupon note a wonderfull contradiction in our doctrine. I maie truelie ſaie your caſe is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, and ſo is theirs that depend vpon you, to be thus abſurdlie and wilfullie blinded in matters of faith, and as it were to grope for light at noone daie, which ſheweth in you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede a notable reprobation of vnderſtanding, as a iuſt puniſhment of your Apoſtaſie. The Church is not inuiſible, becauſe the men of whom the Church conſiſteth are inuiſible (for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and elect in that they are men, are no leſſe viſible then the reſt) but becauſe the elect of God can not be perceaued and acknowledged, by outwarde ſight of our eies. Of Chriſtes bodie
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:27710:27"/>you teach moſt falſlie, that his verie true natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall humane bodie is in the Sacrament, yet that no ſenſe can perceaue it to be there: which is to denie and ouerthrow the trueth of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie. Therfore you ſee (if anie facultie of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remaine in you) that betweene this doctrine <hi>The Church of Chriſt is inuiſible,</hi> that is, <hi>not able by our eies to be diſcerned,</hi> and this, <hi>The bodie of Chriſt if it were preſent in the Sacrament bodelie</hi> (as you teach) <hi>ſhould be viſible,</hi> that is, ſeene with our eies, is not ſo much as a ſhadow or fancie of anie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
            <p>After all this <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> maketh a long diſcourſe of <hi>Dauid George</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtian Caſtalion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 66.</note> of whome or for whome I haue for my parte noe neede to anſwere. <hi>Dauid George</hi> was a damnable heretike, and his hereſies were by Proteſtantes not Papiſtes deſcried and refuted. <hi>Caſtalion</hi> you ſlaunder moſte ſhameleſlie in ſaying he denied Chriſt to be the Meſſias, as hereafter alſo in your booke you haue done. His preface which he writ to King Edwarde before his tranſlation of the Bible, conteineth no ſuch argument, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth whollie to another end, if you had either witt to ſee it, or good will to acknowledge it. Therein he diſputeth that ſome part of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes that are contained in the Prophets, and namelie concerning the great knowledge that ſhould be vnder Chriſt, is not yet accompliſhed: his opinion of which matters I leaue to himſelfe: but you haue not done well to charge him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truelie with ſo foule a blaſphemie.<note place="margin">pag. 70.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As for the great ſtraightes into which <hi>Caluine</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> diſputing with the Iewes haue beene
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:27710:27"/>driuen by reaſon of this ſuppoſition, concerning the Churches fall, I know not anie, ſeing they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer imagined anie ſuch fall, as you doe. No the heauens ſhall ſooner fall, then the Church: and therefore you miſtake the matter whollie, and like an ignorant ſophiſter make impertinent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. The promiſes of almightie God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the largenes and beautie of his Church vnder Chriſt haue beene accompliſhed. The Goſpell hath beene preached throughout the world, the Church hath ſpread it ſelfe ouer all nations, and neuer ſince hath it beene ſhut vp within the limites of one countrie and people, as the Synagogue was. But as the Prophets fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde that the Church ſhould be thus mightelie increaſed and multiplied, ſo the Apoſtles haue prophecied that in the Church ſhould be a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that Antichriſt ſhould ſit in the Temple of God, and that the Princes and people of the earth ſhould be drunken with the cuppe of his ſpirituall fornication and abhominations. As we confeſſe thoſe Prophecies to be fulfilled, ſoe muſt we likewiſe acknowledge the truth of theſe, and thereby we are hable to ſtop the mouthes not onelie of Iewes and Turkes, but of all papiſts alſo, in this controuerſie of the churches outward increaſe and decaie. Your monſtrous railing in the next ſection I pretermit, beſeeching God to open the eies of all Chriſtians, and to giue them vnderſtanding hartes, that they maie diſcerne Antichriſt from Chriſt, falſhood from trueth, and hereſie from pure religion.</p>
            <p>But where you ſaie that there be many worſe Antichriſtes then the Pope,<note place="margin">pag. 73.</note> and compare cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:27710:28"/>of your late Popes with ſome of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Superintendents, as you call them, in reſpect of their behauiour and conuerſation of life, you ſtill miſconſtrue the matter, and ſpeake beſide the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Your Popes might haue vſed greater ſhew of ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſtie and godlines, then they haue done, &amp; yet be neuer the further of from their kingdome of Antichriſt, which although it be much furthered and maintained by their pride, cruelty, couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſuch other moſte monſtrous and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious demeanour, as they haue vſed theſe manie hundred yeares; yet it conſiſteth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie in that doctrine of Antichriſtianitie, which they holde, and by all poſſible meanes defend, moſt contrarie to the holie and Catholike religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And yet if your compariſon were admitted, and the liues of thoſe Antichriſts throughlie exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it would appeere, that there haue not liued euer in anie ſtate from the beginning of the worlde more wicked, vile, and abominable men, then haue bene the Popes of Rome for diuers hundred yeares together by teſtimonie of their owne hiſtories. They haue in tyrannie exceeded <hi>Nero,</hi> in pride <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, in other common vices, them that for the ſame haue bene moſte infamouſlie renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the world: wherein if anie profeſſour of the goſpell ſhould reſemble them, or come neare vnto them, it were a iuſt ſhame vnto their perſon, but yet no diſproofe of their religion.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> proceedeth to another pointe,<note place="margin">pag. 75.</note> namelie the want of religion and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:27710:28"/>which he ſaith I haue ſhewed in this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. A greauous accuſation, in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to want religion, &amp; where greateſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is required, to haue no conſcience at all. But if you examine his proofe, then ſhall you eaſilie perceiue the cauilling ſpirit of this accuſer, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you haue alreadie had, and ſhal hereafter haue moſt euident demonſtration. The fault no dout is verie hainous, wherupon he frameth ſo ſore an inditement, or els he a malitious enemie, that for no cauſe accuſeth ſo bitterlie. If I haue not ſet downe euerie word of <hi>Doctor Saunders</hi> booke, doth it therfore follow that I did it of an irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or vnconſcionable intent?

Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> wholl booke, omitting nothing from the beginning to the end, and made to all that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for maintenance of his ſeuerall cauſes, a moſte learned and perfect anſwere, the which as yet was neuer refelled, nor neuer can be, I am ſure. Now conſider the dealing of <hi>Doctor Harding</hi> in his <hi>Reioynder,</hi> which beſides it is made but to one onelie article of ſeauen and twentie, it hath in a hundred places omitted much, ſo as in truth not halfe the Replie is intirely repeated and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. In the defenſe of the Apologie he hath indeede abridged <hi>Doctor Hardings</hi> Confutation, being of ſuch length and bignes as was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient wholly to be printed with the defenſe. But let them, if they can ſhew ſome argument diſſembled or paſſed ouer in ſilence, in all that which in the impreſſion is omitted. Which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as they cannot, it is no matter, though manie legions of ſuch idle words, as he hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that booke withal, were ſuppreſſed and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And I praie you, how hath <hi>D. Harding</hi> beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him-ſelfe in his <hi>detection?</hi> Hath he done, as you accufe <hi>M. Iewel</hi> for not doeing? Nothing les. Then why ſhould <hi>M. Iewell</hi> be accounted more worthie of blame, then <hi>D. Harding,</hi> hauing made
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:27710:29"/>no other fault, then that wherin <hi>D. Harding</hi> hath much more offended then he?</p>
            <p>That I haue in thoſe places omitted ſome wordes, I graunt, <hi>Master Rainolds:</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 77. &amp;c.</note> and the cauſe thereof I haue trulie declared. But tell me where is any part or proofe of <hi>Saunders</hi> demonſtrations vnanſwered. If you will examine what I haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to euerie one in order, you ſhall finde I haue not dealt any waies vntrulie or craftilie, as you would haue men think I did, but ſoundlie and ſufficientlie diſprooued, whatſoeuer he hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in any Chapter of thoſe fourty demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhort or long. If you be angrie with me for not reciting all his wordes, and anſwering them particularlie, this vnderſtand that I for my parte would rather grinde in a mill, all the daies of my life, then be bound to anſwere ſuch infinite lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacitie, and garrulitie, as <hi>Doctor Saunders,</hi> and your ſelfe, and other your companions vſe in your writings. You poure forth ſuch floodes, or rather ſeas of words, that it is a moſte intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wearines to wade therein, although daunger of drowning, or taking great harme there can be none. But as to anſwere your wordes is a thing moſt tedious, beſides it is vnneceſſarie, ſo your reaſons againe are anſweared with as great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, comforte, and facilitie. And if you thinke I haue not thoroughlie anſweared euerie demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of <hi>Doctor Saunders,</hi> it is free for you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume or proſecute the controuerſie, which no doubt at this time you would haue done, being thereto ſo ſpecially by your ſuperiors appointed, but that you miſtruſted ſomewhat in your cauſe, and in your ſelfe. And although you promiſe ſome
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:27710:30"/>thing ſhall follow hereafter, yet conſidering both the practize of Papiſts, and a prouiſoe which here you make, I thinke we are to looke for litle more at your handes in defenſe of <hi>Saunders</hi> demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Their practiſe is, leſt they might be thought vnhable to anſwere our bookes, to ſet forth ſome anſwere to a part, and then ſo dainlie to breake of with pretenſe of neceſſarie reaſon, and promiſe of proceading further at a more conuenient ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and yet neuer to performe anie ſuch matter. So the defender of the Cenſure in the middes of his anſwere picketh a quarrell to make an end for that preſent, as though he meant at better leaſure to finiſh the whol. But it reſter has he left it then, and ſo is like to doe ſtill. So <hi>Maſter Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> purpoſing perhaps ſome ſuch matter, hath yet prouided aforehand, that if he faile in further anſwere, it ſhall not be taken in euill parte, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath reſtrained his promiſe with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, if he be not letted <hi>by thoſe that haue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of his life and ſtudies.</hi> It may be, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcreet men will ſuffer <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further, leſt as of that, which he hath written alreadie, no great profit hath redounded to their cauſe, ſo in that which is to follow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Antichriſt, he rather hurt them much, then helpe them anie thing at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> concludeth his preface with a certaine Aduertiſement to the Reader,<note place="margin">pag. 84.</note> wherein firſt he noteth what kind of printes and editions he vſeth of ſuch bookes, as commonlie he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, not of the auncient fathers (for of them he alledgeth verie fewe) but of the late writers, with whoſe teſtimonies and ſentences he hath fraugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:27710:30"/>his booke from one end to another. If anie man haue pleaſure or purpoſe to peruſe his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, therein he may be ſomething holpen by this direction, which <hi>M. R.</hi> hath ſo carefully, though not much needfullie, gathered and prefixed before his booke. Albeit I thinke that not many Readers, of what iudgement ſoeuer they are in religion, conſidering how litle waight of matter is in thoſe allegations, wil greatlie cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber themſelues with ſeeking the impreſſions, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the volumes, and peruſing the quotations, the labour being far greater, then the profit.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, he talketh much and diſpureth to and fro by what name he maie call vs, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">pa. 86.</note> or Catholikes, or heretikes, or proteſtants, or Zuinglians, or Sacramentaries, whereof no dout there was great cauſe in this manner to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe the reader. You call vs indeede at your pleaſure by ſuch names as your maliciouſe and railing ſpirites can inuent, ſometime by one, and ſometime by another. Chriſtians and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes you will not haue vs named, reſeruing that denomination to your ſelues, to whome notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of al profeſſors of Chriſtian religion the ſame doth leaſt appertaine. For our partes, ſoe long as we are ſure that the doctrine, which we follow, is the eternall word of God, and goſpell of his ſonne Chriſt, as we are by Gods grace moſt ſure, ſeeing it is plainlie ſet downe in the holie ſcriptures of the olde and new Teſtament, we care not what you thinke of vs, or what you ſpeake of vs, or by what names you reproche vs. If you blaſpheme the doctrine of Chriſt, and call it hereſie, not fearing or ſparing the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:27710:31"/>it is no wonder if you reuile vs with all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious names that can poſſiblie be deuiſed. We tell you notwithſtanding that if a Chriſtian be he that beleeueth in Chriſt, according to his word; if Catholikes be they that profeſſe the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall faith of Chriſt; we are truelie Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Catholikes, beleeuing ſoe, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo. <hi>Lutheranes</hi> we are not, <hi>Zuinglianes</hi> we are not, <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> we are not, becauſe we mantaine not anie priuate or proper doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> or <hi>Caluine,</hi> no more then the faithfull ought in the primitiue Church to haue bene cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Paulines,</hi> or <hi>Petrines,</hi> or <hi>Athanaſians,</hi> or by the name of anie other ſuch miniſter of Chriſt. Be ye called diuerſly, <hi>Franciſcanes, Benedictines, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes, Ieſuites,</hi> and whatſoeuer other title ye can take vp: we are not greeued at the multitude and varietie of your names, who being in truth almoſt anie thing rather then Chriſtians, delight in any name rather, then in the name of Chriſtians. But to vs this one name is ſufficient, and ſuch as are equiualent therewith: we are content with it: we deſire no other. As for the name of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> if you thinke it belongeth not to vs, giue it them whoſe it is: being not a name of Schiſme or ſect, it may as well be vſed, as the name of Catholikes: and for diſtinction ſake onelie, being begon firſt at the diet of Argsburgh, we are enforced to vſe it.</p>
            <p>Laſtlie <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> proteſteth his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to ſubmit himſelfe to the trueth,<note place="margin">pag. 92.</note> 
               <hi>to defend a fault,</hi> or <hi>to correct it.</hi> This indeed is too great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie and readines, whereby it appeereth you are not reſolued in your ſelfe, but can
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:27710:31"/>be content to applie your iudgement and trauail in defenſe or reproofe of anie opinion, good or bad, true or falſe. Correct your faults <hi>Maſter Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi> but leaue of to maintaine them. I haue in this booke made them plaine enough both to your ſelfe and to others: you cannot but ſee them, God giue you grace to acknowledge them, to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them, and, as you haue promiſed, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte them. You knowe that in this booke you haue wrangled without meaſure, you haue railed without ſhame, you haue committed as foule and notorious faults in reaſoning, as anie man could doe: your Logike is naught, your diuinitie is worſe, and your conſcience, as it maie ſeeme, is worſt of all. If there yet remaine in you anie drop of that ſimplicitie, which you profeſſe, then giue ouer defenſe of ſuch vntrueth, reforme your iudgement, and returne by repentance from whence you are fallen, If you continew in willful Apoſtaſie, your blood be vpon your owne head, you haue bene warned, and would not harken. I referre you to the Lordes iudgement, who ſhall get glorie either by your conuerſion and ſaluation, or els by your finall harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and condemnation: <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf, yea the wicked for the daie of euill.</hi>

                  <hi>for that he ſawe vs through diſpaire</hi> (as he ſayeth) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to laie hands, and offer violence to the holie bookes of the Bible.</hi> For proofe whereof <hi>Luther</hi> is charged <hi>to haue written contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſlie, and contumeliouſlie of the Epistle of Saint Iames:</hi> which though it had beene true, and could not haue beene denied, yet did it nothing at all touch vs, who therein agree not with <hi>Luther,</hi> neither are bound to iuſtifie al his ſayings &amp; priuat opinions,

               <p>This might ſuffice men of indifferent reaſon: but our aduerſaries will yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue wrangling about nothing, and will trouble the world with friuolous writings, being neither aſhamed, nor wearied of any thing.

If he had ſo ſpoken, as in trueth he hath not, for any thing I can vnderſtand, what haue they wonne? what haue we loſt? what matter was it, to multiplie words ſo much about? Is this the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie between vs and them? doe we ſtriue about mens words and writings? Is <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> our God, or the author of our faith, or our Apoſtle? No, they ſhall not bring vs thus from the defenſe of Gods trueth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27710:35"/>to skirmiſh with them about mens ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: we will not leaue the great queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion, and fall to diſpute about matters of other nature &amp; condition, ſuch as this is concerning <hi>Luthers</hi> particuler iudgement of S.

The truth of Gods word is it for which we contend, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the which if anie man haue ſpoken any thing, let him beare the blame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and let not the common cauſe be charged therewith. So if <hi>Luther,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other learned man of our ſide, haue eyther interpreted the ſcriptures in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſſe, or haue doubted of ſome one booke of Scripture, whereof doubte alſo hath beene of olde in the Church of Chriſt, we are not to defend their expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, or to approoue their iudgement: and therefore in vaine do theſe men ſpend ſo much time, and take ſuch paynes to prooue, that <hi>Luther vttered reprochfull wordes againſt the Epiſtle of Saint Iames:</hi> which, as though it had beene a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall matter for their aduantage, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the <hi>Cenſurer</hi> in his defenſe, and <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Martin</hi> in his diſcouerie, haue ſpoken thereof, but now alſo my new aduerſarie <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> in his booke againſt me

               <p>And firſt, what a ſillie argument he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth,<note place="margin">M.

For the iniurie done to Saint Iames Epiſtle by <hi>Luther</hi> ſhould not be obiected againſt the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, which doth receiue the ſame, as the Canonicall word of God, but againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> if he did ſo deſerue, and ſuch as maintayne <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion herein.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27710:36"/>But neither I, nor any other that I knowe in our Church euer denied, much leſſe doth the whole Church denie that epiſtle to be worthely rekned among the bookes of ſacred Scripture,<note place="margin">S.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:27710:37"/>build our faith, as ye ſhall neuer be hable to ſhake with all the force ye haue.

               <p>But now to come to <hi>Luther,</hi> whome ſtill you chardge, and me alſo, about Saint Iames epiſtle, I could vſe as many words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, if the cauſe required, as you haue againſt me, &amp; handle the matter by poynts as you doe: but what end, or vſe ſhould there be of ſuch kinde of writing, or what profitt could ariſe thereby to the Church of Chriſt? Had you clerely gayned al that, for which you contend, yet had you not prooued any thing at all againſt our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:27710:38"/>Church, or fayth, nor yet againſt me, but onely that <hi>Luthers</hi> writings haue beene changed, and altered: which becauſe you haue ſo paynfully euicted, I praie you take it vnto you, and vſe it moſte to your aduantage. Howbeit for all your needles and vnthriftie labour ſpent herein, yet doth <hi>Campian</hi> ſtill remayne chardged with that vntrueth, whereof you would ſo fayne acquit him: which you may ſone perceiue, if you call to remembrance what <hi>Campian</hi> in his booke obiected to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther,</hi> concerning this epiſtle of Saint Iames: namely, that he called it <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, ſwelling,</hi>

                  <hi>drye, ſtrawen, and thought it not worthy an Apoſtolike ſpirite.</hi> All this doth <hi>Campian</hi> auouch <hi>Luther</hi> to haue written of Saint Iames epiſtle. Now yf <hi>Luther</hi> haue in deede thus written, then haue I vniuſtly accuſed <hi>Campian</hi> of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth: yf otherwiſe, then hath <hi>Campian</hi> ſlaundered <hi>Luther</hi> fowly. To know the trueth herein. I vſed all conuenient dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in examining all the copies both Dutche and Latine, that I could get: and when I found in them noe ſuch wordes, but rather the cleane contrary, I was perſwaded, as I had good cauſe, that all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:27710:38"/>this was but a forged matter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayd it was vntrue. Afterwards it fell out, that I light vppon an old Dutch Teſtament of Luthers tranſlation, with his prefaces, wherein I found ſomething, like in one poynt to that which <hi>Campian</hi> had obiected: the which when I had read, I diſſembled not, but confeſſed it in my anſwere to <hi>Gregory Martin.</hi> And in that preface <hi>Luther</hi> in deede writeth, that <hi>Saint Iames epiſtle is not ſo worthy, as are the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Saint Peter, and Paul, but in reſpect of them is a ſtrawen epiſtle.</hi> His cenſure I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and ſo himſelfe, I thinke, afterwards, ſeeing thoſe words in latter editions are left out. Yet I truſt euery indifferent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will graunt, that there is ods betweene this that <hi>Luther</hi> writeth indede, and that which <hi>Campian</hi> ſaith he writ. For it is one thing to ſpeake ſimply, and another thing to ſpeake in compariſon. <hi>Campian</hi> ſayth, <hi>Luther calleth Sainte Iames Epistle ſtrawne:</hi> Luther ſayth, <hi>That it is in compariſon of Saint Peters, and Saint Pauls epiſtles, ſtrawne.</hi> If you can by all your wiſdome prooue theſe to be all one, and will farther buſie your ſelfe about trifles, I am content to giue you the reading, but I will not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:27710:39"/>vouchſafe to anſwere any more ſuch ſtrawen, or rather wodden replies. And ſure, <hi>Maſter Rainoldes,</hi> if you can write nothing to purpoſe, and yet will needs be writing ſomething, it were better for you to ſit downe and picke ſtrawes, then ſo to trouble your ſelfe and others, wherein you ſhall purchaſe nothing els but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a ſtrawne writer, and your booke ſhalbe iudged more worthy to be burnt, then to be anſwered.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing you haue taken in hand to proſecute this matter ſo largelie,<note place="margin">M. Rainolds helpeth not, where great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt neede is of his helpe.</note> why doe you faile in that thing wherein moſt of all we need your hand and helpe? For this that you bring concerning <hi>ſtrawne,</hi> hath already beene confeſſed ſomuch as is true: your parte had beene now farther to haue ſhewed, that <hi>Luther</hi> likewſe called the ſame epiſtle <hi>contentious, ſwollen, drie, not worthie an Apostolicall ſpirit,</hi> as he is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Campian</hi> in the ſame place. But for proofe hereof you can bring forth nothing and therefore you confeſſe, that <hi>Campian</hi> layd more to <hi>Luthers</hi> charge concerning this Epiſtle then was true: ſo that if in one poore word you haue a little auouched the credite of your Ieſuite, for whome you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:27710:39"/>fight: yet in three or foure other you haue condemned him: which you ſlylie paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer notwithſtanding, as though <hi>Campian</hi> had neuer ſpoken ſo, or you had nothing to do therwith. Indeed I graunt it maketh ſmale matter, what <hi>Campian</hi> hath lyed of <hi>Luther:</hi> but you that take vppon you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, may not thinke you haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed your duty, if of much that he hath ſaid, you be able to iuſtify his ſaying in one litle point, &amp; in three points haue failed. Wherefore either ceaſe to quarell ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this one word, or ſhew your proofes for the reſt alſo, or acknowledge your lewd and miſerable wrangling, as in deed you muſt, howſoeuer the matter ſtandeth concerning <hi>Luther</hi> in this behalfe. For what if <hi>Luther</hi> had plainly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly affirmed of Saint Iames Epiſtle, as much as <hi>Campian</hi> hath obiected, though vntrulie? Is this a cauſe ſufficient why you ſhould make all theſe outcryes generally againſt all Proteſtants? why then may not we by like reaſon complayne of all Papiſts for that, which Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> hath written both of other bookes of holie ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and namelie of this ſame Epiſtle, whereof we ſpeake? was not <hi>Caietane</hi> a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom Saint Iames Epiſtle Maſter Rainolds procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to entreat of other bookes, refuſed by the Church of England, which yet he ſaith were not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſprooued in times paſt, then that epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Saint Iames: whereupon he would haue his reader beleeue, that in alowing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:27710:43"/>ſome bookes, and reiecting others, we are ledde <hi>by opinion &amp; fanſie, not by learning, or diuinitie.</hi> Wherein, Maſter Rainolds, your ſelfe haue ſhewed, that opinion, not learning, ruled you, when you writ this. For Saint Iames epiſtle was neuer diſproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the wholl Church of God, but onelie by ſome of the Church: but thoſe bookes that are refuſed by vs, were by the wholl Church diſtinguiſhed from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical ſcriptures, &amp; had no greater credit, then they are of with vs, as ſhall appeere.</p>
               <p>The reaſon therefore of our refuſing them, is not, as you imagine, becauſe they containe ſome proofe of your Romiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which we cannot otherwiſe auoid, but by denying the bookes to be of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall authoritie: but becauſe they doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray themſelues of what ſtampe they are by moſt euident markes: and therefore haue bin generally of the wholl Church heeretofore ſette in the ſame degree, that they are left by vs. Theſe Reaſons you ſawe comming againſt you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you durſt not openlie encounter with them, you ſteale by an other way, &amp; let them paſſe. But I muſt call you back a litle, though it be to your griefe and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:27710:44"/>and require of you a plaine and direct anſwere, how thoſe bookes of the olde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which are commonly called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphall,</hi> written firſt in Greeke, or ſome other forraine language, can be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call? For all bookes of holie ſcripture in the olde Teſtament were written, and deliuered to the Church, by the holie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of God, being approoued by certain Teſtimonies to be indeed the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Therefore Abraham anſwered the rich man,<note place="margin">Lue. 16.29.</note> requiring to ſend Lazarus to his fathers houſe, <hi>They haue Moſes and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:</hi> whereby it is plaine, that the wholl doctrine of the church then, was contained in the bookes of Moſes, and the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.19.</note> And Peter ſaith: <hi>we haue a more ſure word of the Prophets,</hi> meaning the ſcriptures of the olde teſtament. And ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Hebrewes writeth that <hi>God ſpake to our fathers by the Prophets.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 1.1.</note> By which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Scripture it is prooued, that none could write bookes to be receiued of the Church for the Canonicall word of God, but onelie they whome God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be his Prophets. But the writers of thoſe Apocriphal books, were no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as may eaſily appeere: For then they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:27710:44"/>would not haue written their bookes in Greeke, as is confeſſed moſt of theſe were, nor in any other tongue, then that which was proper to the Church of God in that time, as Moſes and the Prophets after him, writers of the holie ſcriptures, had done. The Church was then amongſt the Iewes, and the Prophets were the meſſengers, &amp; miniſters of God in that Church, and vnto it they deliuered, &amp; dedicated their bookes. Wherefore the Greeke tongue, being not the tongue of Canaan, nor of the Church then, was not choſen by the Prophets to write, and ſet forth therein the doctrine and Religion of the Lord: ſo that the verie tongue wherein theſe bookes were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten being not the tongue of the Prophets, doth plainlie conuince them to be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical, &amp; therefore no canonical bookes of the olde Teſtament. And here I omitte particular arguments, which might be brought againſt euery one of thoſe bookes ſeuerallie, whereby it may be prooued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincibly, that though you entitle them with the name of Canonical ſcriptures, yet they had not the ſpirite of God for their father.</p>
               <p>Agaynſt this reaſon you bring Saint
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:27710:45"/>Auguſtines authoritie,<note place="margin">De doct. Chriſt. l. <hi>2. 8.</hi>
                  </note> whoe reckoneth them amongſt the Canonicall bookes of ſcripture, and ſo you ſay did the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church of that age. But that this is a moſte manifeſt vntruth, appeereth by S. Ierome,<note place="margin">Praeſa. in Pro. Solom.</note> whoe plainlie writeth that the <hi>Church readeth thoſe bookes, but receiueth them not amongst the Canonicall ſcriptures.</hi> So although Saint Auguſtine had thought them to haue bene of equall authoritie with the writings of the Prophets, which are called properlie Canonicall: yet was not this the common iudgement of the Church in thoſe dayes, as Saint Ierome doth let vs vnderſtand, who liued in the Church of that age.<note place="margin">In what ſenſe S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine calleth theſe bookes canonicall.</note> Saint Auguſtine cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them indeede <hi>Canonicall,</hi> by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and improper acception of that word: becauſe they are red in the Church, and containe profitable and Godlie inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but yet not ſo, as though there were no difference betweene them and the other which are vndoubtedlie Canonicall. For in that very place Saint Auguſtine oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Canonical ſcriptures to ſuch bookes, as <hi>by perilous lies and phantaſies might abuſe the reader,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Periculoſis mendacus &amp; phantiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note> 
                  <hi>and bring preiudice to ſound vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> And then giueth a rule to preferre
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:27710:45"/>thoſe bookes that are receiued of al Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Churches, before them, that ſome Churches receiue: &amp; of thoſe that are not receiued of all, to preferre thoſe that the moſte &amp; of greateſt authority do receiue. wherby you may ſee the vanitie of that you ſaid before, that the catholike church then iudged them to be canonicall. And further if Saint Auguſtine himſelfe had bene of your opinion, he would not haue giuen this admonition to preferre ſome before ſome: but would haue ſtraitly, and preciſely charged, that no difference ſhould be made, but all receiued alike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing al of like authoritie. As for <hi>Daniel,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſome parte of him be written in the Chaldey tongue, yet was it vnderſtood of the Church, being then in captiuitie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Babylonians: and that tongue is but a diuerſe <hi>Dialect</hi> from the Hebrew, and differeth littel from it.</p>
               <p>My ſecond reaſon,<note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> you ſay, is of more force: and if I prooue it, you promiſe to be of my iudgement. Let vs then ſet downe the reaſon firſt, and ſee the proofes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. I ſayd, betwene thoſde bookes <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphes</hi> of the old Teſtament, and Saint Iames epiſtle there was this difference, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:27710:46"/>they were refuſed of the wholl Church, and ſo was not Saint Iames: wherfore we had reaſon to reiecte them, and not this. By the wholl Church I meant, not onely the primitiue Church of Chriſtians, as you ſuppoſed, but the Church of the Iewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, which neuer allowed thoſe bookes for Canonicall, as your ſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: which is an inuincible argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. For had they bene Canonical, that Church would not, nor ought not to haue reiected them: and other Church there was none then, to allowe them. So by your iudgement it muſt be thought that diuerſe bookes of Canonicall ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were neuer receiued for many yeares in any Church: which howe abſurde it is euery man ſeeth. The Apoſtle writeth, that vnto the <hi>Iewes were committed the oracles of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3.2.</note> whereby is meant his word: But theſe bookes the Iewes neuer receiued, and therefore they are of another ſorte, then thoſe that containe the oracles of God. And that the Iewes did not amiſſe, in reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them, it may be vnderſtoode in that they were neuer reprooued by Chriſt or his Apoſtles for the ſame. Their falſe expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſcripture are often tymes noted, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:27710:46"/>their errours confuted: but they are neuer found fault with, for refuſing theſe bookes of ſcripture, whereof if they had bene guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they ſhould not haue eſcaped reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This argument you deale not with: but expound my words of the primitiue Church, whereas I ſpake ſpecially of the Church before Chriſt. For though the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church neuer thought theſe bookes to be Canonicall, as that word is properlie taken, yet it vſed in ſome places to read them, <hi>for inſtruction of manners,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hieron. praef. in Solom.</note> 
                  <hi>not for confirmation of faith,</hi> as S. Ierome tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth: but the olde Church of the Iewes neuer vouchſafed them ſo much honour as to read them publikelie. And that the Catholike Church receiued not theſe bookes for Canonicall, though it read them, you haue alreadie heard the witnes of Saint Ierome: who alſo in another place writing expreſſely of the Canonicall bookes,<note place="margin">Hieron. in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logo Galeats.</note> excludeth theſe out of the Canon, and calleth them <hi>Apochryphall.</hi> Hereunto might I adde many teſtimonies of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and writers, both olde, and newe, wherein appeareth what iudgement the Catholike Church had of theſe bookes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, whoe in your opinion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:27710:47"/>was the head of the Catholike Church, being Biſhop of Rome,<note place="margin">Writers old and new e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme thoſe bookes for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphall</note> and therefore one that by likelyhood ſhould not be ignorant of the Churches iudgement, calleth the bookes of <hi>Macchabees not Canonicall, yet ſet forth to the edification of the Church.</hi>

                  </note> Thus for 600. yeares after Chriſt you ſee theſe bookes were not eſteemed in the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church for Canonicall: which alſo muſt be thought of the reſt, whereof we ſpeake, ſeeing there is one and the ſame iudgement of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all.

Yea ſince your Tridentine aſſembly <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> a man of your owne ſide, though not ſo abſurd, &amp; corrupt in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as moſte of you, in his Hebrew Bible interlined, is not affrayd thus to write of the ſame bookes, and that not in a corner, but in the very forefront, and principal leafe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:27710:47"/>of the booke. <hi>There are added</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>in this edition the bookes written in Greeke,<note place="margin">Bibilia Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tani. <hi>1584.</hi>
                     </note> which the catholike Church, following the canon of the Hebrews, reckneth among the Apochry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall.</hi> Thus it is euident, that theſe bookes haue beene, and are refuſed by the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, and that our Church iudgeing them <hi>Apochrypall,</hi> conſenteth with the iudgement of the catholike Church; and yours in receiuing them for canonicall, haue not herein a catholike iudgement.</p>
               <p>Now for Saint Iames epiſtle, where you demaund how it may appeere that it was not refuſed by the wholl Church, I would know, whether you will ſay it was indeed refuſed by the wholl Church, or no? if you will ſo ſay, then you ſhall, as much diſcredite the authoritie thereof,<note place="margin">S. Iames epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reiected by the wholl Church, but by ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches onely.</note> as euer <hi>Luther</hi> or anie Proteſtant hath done. For as the wholl Church neuer receiued anie booke for canonical, but that which was truelie Canonicall: ſo the wholl Church hath neuer refuſed any as Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall, but ſuch as were indeed Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall. If then the wholl Church of Chriſt hath refuſed Saint Iames Epiſtle, it will neceſſarilie follow, that S. Iames Epiſtle is not canonicall. But that the wholl
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27710:48"/>Church euer refuſed it, is vntrue, as maybe prooued by the teſtimonies of writers, and Hiſtories of the Church.<note place="margin">Euſe. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>23.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that was the greateſt aduerſarie of it, and did moſt ſharplie cenſure it, yet in the ſame place confeſſeth, that <hi>both that and the reſt were receiued and publiſhed in moſte Churches.</hi> Wherfore when you ſaie,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> that for this part <hi>you muſt credit me vpon my word,</hi> herein you bewray either great ignorance, or deſire to quarrell. The difference then which I put betweene the Apocryphall bookes of the olde teſtament, and theſe bookes of the newe, that they were reiected by the Church wholie, theſe not ſo, is fullie proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: whereupon it followeth that the Church of England had greater reaſon to refuſe them, then theſe, and was therein led by learning, &amp; knowledge, not by fanſie and opinion, as you ſaie. What learning, or what diuinitie is your Church led by, firſt to eſteem of theſe alike, then to alowe for Canonicall, ſuch bookes, as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and can not denie to haue beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by the wholl Church?</p>
               <p>Where you ſay, my reaſons make moſte againſt my ſelfe,<note place="margin">pag. 23.</note> I know not how I could
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:27710:48"/>haue written more plainelie, &amp; more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonantlie to my ſelfe, then I haue done. But ſome are ſo froward, that though it be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into them with hammer, yet they will not ſeeme to vnderſtand. I ſaie <hi>Luther</hi> followed the iudgement of the auncient Church, in refuſing Saint Iames Epiſtle. what maketh this againſt my ſelfe? Can you deny but ſome of the ancient Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es refuſed it? Doth not <hi>Euſebius</hi> prooue it, when he ſaith, <hi>it was receiued in moſte Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</hi> Then it followeth, not in al Churches. And would <hi>Euſebius</hi> haue called it a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard,</hi> if ſome Churches had not ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of it? But what if ſome refuſed it? doth it follow therefore that the wholl Church did ſo? you maie not thinke, <hi>M. Rainolds,</hi> to caſt vpon vs ſuch a miſte, but that we ſhal be hable to eſpie your walking along. Saint Iames epiſtle was neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed of all Churches generally, it was refuſed onelie by ſome: <hi>Luther</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing it agreed with the auncient Churches, not with all, but ſome, as many as refuſed it. But the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Churches receiued it, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> witneſſeth, and our Church is led by Gods ſpirit, and true learning, to follow them.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:27710:49"/>But for the <hi>Apochryphall</hi> bookes of the olde Teſtament, I haue prooued ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and can further declare, if neede require, that both the greateſt part of the Church, and the wholl Church hath reprooued them. As for that <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayth, The Church readeth them, it maketh litle for their credit,<note place="margin">S.

               <p>The Tower conference is here brought in to no purpoſe.<note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note> Their ſcope was to ſhew, that in the primitiue Church, not onely ſome particuler perſons, but wholl congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations haue doubted of many bookes of Scripture, and yet notwithſtanding loſt not their dignite of true Churches of Chriſt: and therefore that <hi>Luther</hi> doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or denying ſome of them, cannot for that cauſe iuſtelie in any indifferent iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be condemned, ſeeing whatſoeuer they obiect againſt <hi>Luther</hi> in this behalfe

Wherefore your concluſion that you ſet downe in the end of this your idle, &amp; wandring talke, is onelie deuiſed of your ſelfe, and not maintained by vs. For you father vpon vs, that we thinke we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe all ſuch bookes, as of olde haue bene doubted of:<note place="margin">pag. 28.</note> which is as farre from our thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as heauen is from earth: and if any man haue euer vttered ſuch a thing, as I thinke none hath, it is his owne priuat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, not the approoued and conſtant iudgement of our Church. The bookes in the olde Teſtament, that we refuſe, beſides that they carie in their foreheades euident notes of Apochryphall writings, haue not onelie bene doubted of, but clean caſt awaie by the Church of God, as hath bene prooued: all the bookes in the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doe we whollie admit as canonical, not refuſing any parcell or word thereof, becauſe we acknowledge in them the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and ſee no reaſon to mooue vs otherwiſe. For though they haue beene doubted of in former times, yet it was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no certaine ground, and by fewe, in compariſon of thoſe that receiued them,

               <p>But here is by the waie to be noted, how this man ſeeking to diſprooue my compariſon of the ſunne,<note place="margin">pag. 36.</note> hath ſuddenlie ouerthrowen the principall ſtaie of their religion, which is the viſiblenes of the Church. That <hi>which is knowen by ſenſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is no article of faith: for theſe two are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite.</hi> Then the Church is not knowne by ſenſe: and ſo viſiblenes is not a marke of the Church.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:27710:54"/>well, but then it is againſt your ſelfe. The ſimilitude was brought not to match our beliefe of ſcripture with knowledge of the ſunne, that as we know the one by ſenſe, ſo the other: but that we haue certaine and vndoubted beliefe of the canonicall ſcriptures by themſelues, as we know the ſunne by it ſelfe. Your beliefe in deede of the bookes of ſcripture is naturall, and to vſe your owne example, ſuch, as when you beleeue <hi>Tuſculans Queſtions</hi> to be written by <hi>Tullie.</hi> For as you are ledde thus to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue of this booke becauſe it hath bene ſo accounted in all times by conſtant traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euer ſince: ſo likewiſe you haue no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon to diſcerne the canonicall ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures from other bookes, but onely this common receiued opinion of the Church, which you call <hi>Tradition.</hi> We haue this as well as you, and we haue alſo an other, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſurer then this, which you haue not: yea, which you blaſphemouſly deride, the teſtimony of the ſpirit, wherby the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the ſcriptures is ſealed in our harts and we are throughly induced to receiue them, as the moſt bleſſed Teſtament, and trueth of God. For example, that there is a God, who created heauen and earth, both
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:27710:55"/>the Scriptures teache, and the creatures them-ſelues confirme, ſoe as no man ought to ſtand in doubt thereof, Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this perſuaſion cannot be faithfullie ſetled and rooted in mans hearte, vnleſſe it be approoued, and as it were ſealed vnto vs by the holie Ghoſt: without the confirmation whereof, great doubtfulnes and diſtruſt will ariſe in our mindes continuallie, through the greate corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our nature. Euen ſo that theſe ſcriptures are in trueth the verie word of God, not onelie them ſelues doe prooue by their ſubiecte matter, &amp; argument, but alſo the teſtimony &amp; iudgement of the Church, which euer ſo eſteemed them, may inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciblie argue the ſame. And yet for all this that we faithfullie receiue them, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelues vnto them, as to the word of God, without wandring or ſuſpicion, Gods holie ſpirit muſt inwardlie perſwade our heartes, that this indeede is his word, and therefore of vs by all meanes to be imbraced, and beleeued.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:27710:67"/>Chriſt.

               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>that the auncient fathers acknowledge Melchiſedech to haue ſacrificed in bread and wine, and ſo to haue foreſhewed Chriſtes ſacrificing in like manner.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What is to be anſwered to the fathers comparing Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deches bread and wine to the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per</note> To this an eaſie anſwere maie ſerue.

Secondlie, that the fathers, not one of them all, applie
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:27710:67"/>this of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> to the Popiſh maſſe, which was not hatched in the daies of the ancient fathers, but is a latter birde of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts brood. Thirdly, that none of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers do prooue by this any real ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Church, wherein Chriſt is to be offered continuallie, as the Papiſts doe moſt wickedlie and horriblie maintaine. Laſtlie the fathers onely meant to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the excellency of the Lords ſupper, which Chriſt inſtituted in bread and wine, by this fact of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> that brought forth bread and wine, as it were in theſe ſignes ſhadowing and figuring Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, who long after appointed the ſame to be ſacraments of his body and blood. This was the cauſe why they ſo often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this example of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> as you may perceiue by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who ſaith. <hi>In ſacerdote Melchiſedech ſacrifice, Dominici ſacramentum praefiguratum videmus:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Cypr. ep. <hi>63.</hi>

               <p>In that you beare your reader in hand, I haue diſſented from <hi>Caluin,</hi> and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, that argueth a weakenes of your braine, which cauſeth you to vtter ſuch idle talke.

               <p>In this taking you beginne to throw out arguments,<note place="margin">Pag 63.</note> which muſt needs be full ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie and miſerably made.

Neither of theſe parts ſhall you prooue whilſt you liue, though you liue the laſt on the earth. For what
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:27710:69"/>ſacrifice offered Chriſt at his ſupper? and what was the effect thereof? was this a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice according to the order of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech?</hi> then was it not the ſame he offered on the Croſſe: for that was not of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedechs</hi> order, being not in bread and wine, as you will haue it, but the verie bodie of Ieſus Chriſt. But your Church maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that the ſacrifice which Chriſt offered at his ſupper, was the ſame that he offered on the Croſſe. Thus handſomelie your dreames hang togeather.</p>
               <p>Againe if Chriſt at his ſupper offered ſuch a ſacrifice, as was prefigured by <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> which you affirme, then muſt it followe that Chriſt fulfilled that figure perfectlie, and ſo the ſame ſacrifice nead no more to be offered: whereof enſueth the deſolation of your maſmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, whoſe occupation onelie and whollie ſtandeth in renewing the ſacrifice of the maſſe. Then would I demaund what vertue and effect that ſacrifice had, which you teach to haue bene offered by Chriſt at his ſupper? Did Chriſt thereby fullie appeaſe the wrath of his father? Did he fullie redeme mankinde? Or did he theſe things, but yet ſo ſlenderly &amp; inſufficiently, that there needed another
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:27710:69"/>ſacrifice after, namelie his owne death vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe?

               </p>
               <p>And becauſe you framed an argument for me, as you ſay, I will doe as much for you, and thus I frame you another. <hi>If Chriſt offered are all externall ſacrifice of him ſelfe at his ſupper in bread &amp; wine, then did Chriſt fully redeeme mankinde by a ſacrifice made in bread and wine: But Chriſt redeemed not the world, by a ſacrifice made in bread &amp; wine, but by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his owne bodie vpon the croſſe: Ergo Chriſt offered no ſuch ſacrifice, in bread and wine at his ſupper.</hi> The partes are plaine, &amp; need no further proofe. And where you ſay, that <hi>ſeeing Chriſt was prefigured by Aaron</hi> &amp; <hi>Melchiſedech, therefore he offered a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice both in bloody maner, as Aaron did, and in vnbloodie, as did Melchiſedech,</hi> I ſee you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to put life into the dead carcaſe of your argument, but all in vaine. For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſhewed either by ſcriptures, or els by anie ancient fathers of the Church, that Chriſt offered any reall ſacrifice, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in bloody maner.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.14.</note> Wherefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſo often repeateth the word <hi>(Once)</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding thereby all other maners of offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:27710:70"/>this ſacrifice, but one. <hi>By one oblation</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hath he made perfect for euer thoſe that are ſanctified.</hi> Tell vs what maner of oblation that was, bloody, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloodie? bloodie, I truſt, you will confeſſe: and therefore no vnbloodie was neceſſary, which neither could haue holpen, <hi>ſeeing without ſhedding of blood there is not anie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9.22.</note> Whereby alſo may appeare that though the ſacrifice of the maſſe be gainfull to ſuch Popiſh Prieſts, as <hi>M.

Such marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize is lightlie to be valued, as it deſerueth.</p>
               <p>But to anſwere a litle further, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> the ſimilitude between him and Chriſt conſiſteth not in offering vnbloodie ſacrifice,<note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects Melchi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſedech was a figure of Chriſt.</note> as you vntruelie and wickedlie imagine, but as the Apoſtle teacheth, in that <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> was both a king, and a prieſt, and is ſette forth vnto vs in the ſcripture as eternall, and more excellent then <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the <hi>Leuitical prieſts.</hi> In theſe reſpects was he a figure of Chriſt the eternal king and prieſt, farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling al the prieſts of the <hi>Leuiticall</hi> order. Becauſe theſe thinges make nothing for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:27710:70"/>your ſacrifice, you deuiſe a matter that was not, to prooue a thing that is not, and ſo build one lie vpon another, the vnbloody ſacrifice of Chriſt vpon the vnbloodie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi> But this is the iuſt iudgement of the Lord vpon you, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you haue troden vnder your feet, the blood of the euerlaſting Teſtament, you ſhould be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer to effectual illuſions, to embrace an vnbloodie ſacrifice, which is the deuiſe of your owne braine, for the true &amp; glorius ſacrifice of Chriſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe.</p>
               <p>This former argument of <hi>M.R.</hi> hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten another like to it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Pag. 64.</note> or rather more monſtrous.

                  <hi>They whoe may &amp; ought to offer ſacrifice, as did firſt Melch. &amp; afterward Chriſt, are truely &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie ſacerdotes: But priests of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may &amp; ought to offer ſacrifice in ſuch ſort: ergo they are truly &amp; properly ſacerdotes, prieſts.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is the ſame with the concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your other argument, as euidently falſe, as the word of god is clearlie &amp; vndouted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie true. For if your prieſts offer ſacrifice, as <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> and Chriſt did, then are they prieſts of <hi>Melch.</hi> order, &amp; not prieſts onely but kings. For ſo was he the figure, &amp; ſo is Chriſt the truth. You cannot pul in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:27710:71"/>theſe two offices, but if you wil needs be prieſts, &amp; that properly, according to this order of <hi>Melchiſ.</hi> then ſeeing that order of prieſthood hath a kingdome inſeparablie annexed to it, it muſt neceſſarilie followe, that you are alſo kinges, and that properlie, which were a verie proper thing indeede, and greatlie to be accounted of.<note place="margin">Popiſh prieſts if they be ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cording to Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dechs order, muſt not be prieſts onelie, but alſo kings</note> If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide theſe offices in ſunder, it is blaſphemy; making a Prieſt according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> whoeis not alſo a king: If you take both iointlie to your ſelues, then will euerie hedge Prieſt be a gentleman, a lord, a King.

Anie man then, that hath but halfe an eie, maie ſoone ſee, that the holie ghoſt in auoiding this name ſo carefullie, hath giuen our Popiſh Prieſts a cleane wipe, and both left them out of the dore, and ſhut the dore againſt them: &amp; though they ſtriue neuer ſo much to creepe in, yet are they to be driuen awaie by lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and kept forth, as they that haue nothing at all to do in Gods howſe.</p>
               <p>But here M.

He bids me ſhew where this Church for many hundred yeares was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouerned

                  </gap>, that is, <hi>an euerlaſting Prieſthoode.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that paſſeth not away from one to an other. And herein the Apoſtle compareth our ſauiour Chriſt with the Prieſts of <hi>Aarons</hi> order, &amp; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a manifeſt difference, that the <hi>Leuitical</hi> Prieſthood reſted not in one man, but went from man to man, <hi>by reaſon of death,</hi> which ſuffered not one &amp; the ſame Prieſt continuallie to enioie his office: but <hi>Chriſt liueth for euer,</hi> and therefore his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood abideth with him onelie,<note place="margin">The Apoſtles reaſon exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh prieſts no les then the Leuitical.</note> and is not in execution enlarged to anie other. And this reaſon of the Apoſtle debarreth as wel the popiſh, as the <hi>Aaronical</hi> prieſts. For the Prieſts of the popiſh order are no more exempted from neceſſitie of dying, then were thoſe prieſts of <hi>Aarons</hi> ſtocke, ſo that they are no leſſe oppoſed vnto Chriſt, then the other.</p>
               <p>Herein therefore lieth the force of the Apoſtles argument, that the Prieſthood of the new Teſtament belongeth onely vnto him, that is immortal: for otherwiſe he had not put anie neceſſarie difference betwene that and the other: whereof it doth inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciblie, and neceſſarielie enſue, that the onelie prieſt of the new Teſtament, is Ieſus
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:27710:76"/>Chriſt. This <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> concludeth out of the Apoſtles words moſte plainly:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>As there were</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>manie prieſts, becauſe they were mortall ſo there is but one, becauſe he is immortall.</hi> For can they anſwere for them ſelues, that though they die, yet Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, whoſe partners herein they recken them ſelues to be? might not the Iewiſh prieſts likewiſe haue ſaid as much, ſeeing it cannot be denied, but their prieſthood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was referred vnto Chriſt? But as thoſe Prieſts togeather with their Prieſthood expired, when our ſauiour Chriſt, the true Prieſt and ſacrifice, was exhibited, ſo their was no place left for other Prieſts, nor other ſacrifice, all figures being in Chriſt moſte fullie and perfectlie accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. Yet as though Chriſt had bene either a mortall prieſt like to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his children, or his ſacrifice had not at once ſatisfied the wrath of God, they ſubſtitute to Chriſt an infinite multitude of prieſtes, far moe then were euer the <hi>Leuitical prieſts,</hi> &amp; take vpon them blaſphemouſly to offer againe daily the ſame ſacrifice that Chriſt once offered, which is impoſſible for any to offer, but onely the ſonne of God himſelfe. O that Chriſtian people would conſider
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:27710:76"/>the horrible dongeon of iniquitie, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hid vnder the abhominable ſacrifice of the popiſh maſſe, then which the ſunne did neuer beholde a thing more lothſome and deteſtable in the eies of the God of heauen.</p>
               <p>This therefore is a ſure reaſon, and ſhal ſtand againſt the gates of hell, and force of all papiſtes, that Chriſt is a Prieſt for euer, and hath an euerlaſting Prieſthood. Therefore he is the onely Prieſt of the new Teſtament, and his Prieſthood is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to anie other: and ſo your prieſtes are no prieſts, your ſacrifice is no ſacrifice, your Religion is no Religion, your Chriſt is no Chriſt, your God is no God. Depart from them whoſoeuer will not be partakers of their condemnation.</p>
               <p>To ſhew this reaſon to be childiſh,<note place="margin">Pag. 76.</note> you haue brought indeed a childiſh exception. <hi>Chriſt is</hi> (you ſaie) <hi>a true man for euer, a king for euer, our doctor, master, and teacher for euer: yet are there many men, kings, doctors, &amp; teachers, beſides Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An obiection of M.R. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> This man is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlie ſo drowned in the dreggs of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, that he hath loſt all taſte and ſenſe of trueth: for els he would haue bene aſhamed of ſuch an anſwere, which nothing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:27710:77"/>neare the matter. We ſpeake of thoſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which Chriſt was apointed to beare by the annointing of the holie ghoſt, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial commiſſion from God: you bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of things that be of an other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nature, as to be a true man, an earthlie King, an outward miniſter of the word, &amp; ſuch like. Chriſt is our onelie king, Prophet, and Prieſt: ſo that in this ſenſe, in which theſe are giuen to him, none can be King, Prophet, or Prieſt, but he. For he onelie is our ſpiritual King, he onely is our teacher, and author of all heauenlie doctrine, he onelie can offer the ſacrifice propitiatorie for the ſinnes of the world. If you thinke anie can be a King or Prophet in this manner, but onelie he, you take his honour from him, and giue it to an other, to whome it doth not appertaine: which you do indede moſt notably in ſeſing your ſelues vpon his Prieſthood, which doth as truelie belong to him alone, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Kingdome and Prophecie do. Now then weigh with your ſelfe, what a witles obiection you haue made: and if you can bring no better defenſe for your Prieſtes, then your haue hetherto done, you haue good cauſe to be ſorie, and aſhamed
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:27710:77"/>that euer you changed your copie, and of a miniſter of the Goſpel, became a prieſt of the popiſh order. God giue you grace to repent, that the fruite of Chriſtes prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood maie not be denied vnto you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daie.</p>
               <p>That which followeth, is but a ſupplie of ſuperfluous wordes, without wit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out learning, without trueth. The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon you make betwene an earthly prince and Chriſt, doth nothing fit your purpoſe. For if you haue as lawfull authoritie vnder Chriſt to exerciſe a prieſthood, as the ciuil gouernours haue vnder their prince to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute their office laid vpon them, then ſhew your commiſſion, and we require no more. For as no man dare preſume in the af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>faires of the ſtate to commaund or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe anie thing in the princes name with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſufficient warrant from the prince: ſo maie no man take vpon him anie eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall function in the Church, vlnes he haue a commaundement from the Lord. But Chriſt neuer gaue you anie ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, he neuer laid vpon you any ſuch office, he neuer called you to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to be his fellow prieſtes: els bring vs your Charter, that we maie ſe it, and ſhew
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:27710:78"/>vs your letters of orders, that we may trie them. And further you are to conſider that although the prince beſtow offices &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments vpon his ſubiects, as pleaſeth him, yet his Regalities he keepeth to himſelfe, and no ſubiect wil preſume to chalenge them. <hi>Pharao</hi> gaue <hi>Ioſeph</hi> as great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as anie princes vſe to giue anie of their ſeruants: yet the chaire of eſtate he kept to himſelfe, &amp; therin he was aboue him. But you moſte rudelie and arrogantlie intrude your ſelues into Chriſts ſeate, and will not onelie be his viceprieſts, but as good prieſts as he, ioined in the ſame commiſſion with him, according to the ſame order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> that he was of: &amp; ſo you are not content with ſuch offices as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vnto you, but you claime his chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt principalities, which is no leſſe a fault, then high treaſon againſt the hieſt maieſty.</p>

Wherein as he hath giuen a right ſentence agreably to gods word, ſo hath he marked with a black cole the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of the Romiſh ſectaries, whoſe whol repentance is nothing els, but a voluntarie affliction of their bodies, by abſtaining fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meats, by whipping their carcaſes, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on rough apparrel, by lying hard, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:27710:81"/>ſuch other outward exerciſes, of which the Apoſtle generallie pronounceth,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>they profit but a litle.</hi> Then he muſt confeſſe, that <hi>Repentance</hi> ſtandeth not in outward penance, as they tearme it, but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſorowe of the ſoule. For this alone pleaſeth God, &amp; turneth awaie his wrath from vs although we doe not ioyne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with externall penance: but externall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is nothing worth, vnles we haue an inward ſorowe. Seeing then true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance maie ſtand without that painful, and extreame puniſhing of the body, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude by neceſſarie conſequence of reaſon, that it is not anie parte of true repentance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſometime it hath a profitable vſe, for the furthering and practizing of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. If you graunt this, as you muſt, then we ſhall agree in this matter. For I denie not, but ſome outward penalties maie be vſed, and doe pleaſe God, not of them ſelues, but becauſe they helpe as meanes in true repentance. As for example, he that offendeth in eating or drinking too much, muſt not thinke tha he hath ſufficientlie repented of his ſinne, if he puniſh him ſelfe by faſting neuer ſo much, vnles he be alſo inwardlie ſorowfull for the ſame, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:27710:81"/>purpoſe euer after to liue ſoberlie: which affection if it be wanting, though a man faſt all his life long, yet he hath not truelie repented. But the godlie Chriſtian, whoe hath perhappes oftended in ſurfeting, or dronkenneſſe, and is trulie ſorowfull there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hath repented, though he faſt not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie Fridaie from morning to night, but vſeth a ſober and moderate diet euerie day. Neuertheles if he preſcribe vnto himſelfe, without ſuperſtition of ſatisfaction or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, ſome abſtinence for a time, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may be further eſtraunged from that vice, whoe will denie but this is well and Chriſtianlike done? And this was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by God in publike and priuate faſtes, and practiſed by the godlie, as wee read in the ſcriptures. Thus may you ſee what an idle head you haue, that alleadge ſo many teſtimonies of ſcripture, to prooue a thing, which no man euer hath denied. I perceiue your leiſure is great, but you ſhould haue more diſcretion to vſe it well. In a plaine caſe, wherein we need not your helpe, you bring plentie of ſcriptures: in a matter of controuerſie and debate, which beggeth reliefe at your hands, you paſſe by, as though you heard not: which yet I
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:27710:82"/>impute not to want of compaſſion, but of habilitie. We diſpute not whether the children of God haue vſed, and ought to vſe ſometimes outward puniſhing and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of their bodies (for this we do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie confeſſe) but whether this outward affliction be a proper part of repentance, and whether it ſatisfieth for ſinnes. The firſt is an error, the ſecond is an hereſie, or rather blaſphemy. Theſe things you ſhould haue prooued, for theſe we denie: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being not denied, required no proofe.</p>

Wherein now haue I ſwarued from <hi>M. Martins</hi> purpoſe?

                  <hi>to finiſh our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in feare and trembling:</hi> his meaning is nothing leſſe then to aſcribe the finiſhing of our ſaluation to good workes, as though the Lord began, and left the reſt for vs to fi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſh: but to teach, that we muſt runne our race in careful obedience to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, vntil we come to the end of our courſe, &amp; receiue our reward. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may you beare vs in hand here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the kingdome of god is called in the ſcriptures a reward of our weldoing, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it dependeth vpon the worthines
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:27710:88"/>and merit of our good deedes. For it is a free reward of onely grace, not of deſert or merite: as the father rewardeth his ſonne of loue and fauour, not of debt, ſeeing he oweth him nothing at all. This you haue bin anſwered a thouſand times: &amp; though you can ſaie nothing to purpoſe againſt it, yet you will not ſubmit your heartes to the trueth of God, but ſeeke occaſions of wrangling without ende.</p>
               <p>Fourthly you ſay, I vnderſtand not the ſtate of the queſtion,<note place="margin">pag. 103. &amp;c.</note> wherof I write: and then you make a long diſcourſe of grace, and workes, of mercy and iuſtice, to prooue that in the regenerate there is not any contrariety betweene theſe, but that they maie ſtand wel together. A man would think your ſelfe were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of the matter whereof you ſpeake, taking vpon you to reforme the iudgement of an other: yet haue you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in bewraied more want of skill, then I would haue thought hadde bene in you, vnleſſe perhaps you diſſemble your knowledge, which I do not eaſilie beleeue. For although grace is not contrarie to workes, becauſe the cauſe cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:27710:89"/>to the thing, whereof it is the cauſe, yet whoe ſeeth not that grace may haue an other effect beſides good workes, where of it ſelfe, alone is the cauſe, and muſt not in that reſpect be ioined with good works, but diſcerned, and diſtinguiſhed from them? By <hi>grace</hi> in this controuerſie I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, not thoſe graces of Gods ſpirit, which are infuſed into vs, when we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, as our aduerſaries doe, making grace and workes all one, but the loue and mercie of God, as the ſcriptures haue taught vs to take the ſame: as when the faithfull ſeruants of God are ſaid to haue found <hi>grace</hi> in the eyes of the Lord: and when the Apoſtle writeth,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.6.</note> that <hi>grace</hi> was giuen vnto vs in Ieſus Chriſt before all worlds. And ſo likewiſe in this queſtion muſt it be taken, when we are ſaid to be elected, called, iuſtified, &amp; ſaued by grace, that is, by the loue of God, where with he embraced vs freelie, vnles you will ſaie we had grace and good workes inherent in vs before we were create<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, yea before the world it ſelfe was framed. From this <hi>grace</hi> procede both good workes and our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet ſo as ſaluation is to be imputed, not to our workes, but onelie to grace, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:27710:89"/>although theſe two are not contrarie the one to the other, yet in the matter of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is not the leaſt cooperation between good workes &amp; grace, but works are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie excluded from all ſocietie or fellowſhip in that buſines.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.6.</note> So the Apoſtle hath plainlie taught: <hi>If by grace, not of workes.</hi> Againe, <hi>If righteouſnes be by the law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2.21. Rom, 4.2.</note> 
                  <hi>then hath Chriſt died in vaine:</hi> Againe, <hi>If Abraham were iuſtifyed by workes, he hath whereof to boaſt,</hi>

Thus haue I brieflie anſwered all your friuolous diſcourſe, and ſhewed that you obiecting ignorance of the queſtion to me, in trueth neuer vnderſtood it rightlie your ſelfe.</p>

When god elected vs to be his children, before we had done good or euill, yea when he gaue vs the firſt iuſtice, as you cal it, when we had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted manie ſinnes, and oftentimes offended him, was not this of onely grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, without our worthines and deſert? you will not deny. Yet in this remained he iuſt, vnles you ſay that God is vniuſt in ſome of his dealings. Then is your argument in miſerable caſe, whereof you make ſo great account, God doth giue to his children e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life of iuſtice, therfore not of grace. God is iuſt, in that he keepeth promiſe, and doth not deceiue his of that reward,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:27710:91"/>which they hope for: but the promiſe is free. For freely he promiſed, and freely he giueth. Yet in that he bound himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by his free promiſe, it was iuſt that he ſhould performe the ſame, not for that we haue iuſtlie, and worthely deſerued anie part of that reward, but becauſe it is meet that God be alwaies faithfull in his words. And as for that you alleadge of <hi>Reward,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rendering,</hi> you haue bene anſwered, that this reward and retribution is of the free mercy and grace of god: which anſwere you cannot diſprooue, and therfore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you haue ſaid, is to no purpoſe at al. <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> now muſt help you, or els you are gone. Yet ſaith he not in theſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, that workes do fullie and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctlie deſerue the crowne of immortalitie, as you ſay, and more too.

               <p>One other place more out of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> wherein he writeth moſte ſweetlie and comfortablie, that the teſtimony of a good conſcience conſiſteth in three things. <hi>For firſt of all, it is neceſſarie to beleeue, that thou

Now then peruſe ouer againe your wholl tale, and weigh it in a true balance, and you ſhall finde it lighter then anie fether.</p>
               <p>Fiftlie you obiect, <hi>that I vnderſtand not our owne doctrine,</hi> and here according to your maner,<note place="margin">Pag. 110. &amp;c.</note> you wander vp and downe, as a man that had loſt his waie, who though he knowe not whether to goe, yet wil be going ſtill.

Where I ſaie, that we muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſuffer with Chriſt, if we will be glorified with Chriſt, this ſeely ſophiſter asketh, <hi>how this ſtandeth with our doctrine of onelie faith:</hi> as though there were anie likenes of contradiction at all, betweene theſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:27710:98"/>two ſayings. For knowe you what is meant by <hi>onelie faith?</hi> If you doe not, you are to blame to charge me with ignorance of that, which your ſelfe do not vnderſtand:<note place="margin">Iuſtification by faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excludeth not neceſſary dueties of Chriſtian obe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dience.</note> if you doe, then can you not but plainlie perceiue, that the doctrine of <hi>neceſſarie ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with Chriſt,</hi> is not anie waie contrary to the Doctrine of our <hi>iustifying by faith onelie.</hi> Although we trulie teach, that onelie faith doth iuſtifie, becauſe it is the onlie inſtrument, by which we take holde vpon Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo are iuſtified: yet we teach that iuſtifiing faith can neuer lacke good workes, and hereof it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that whoſoeuer hath faith, muſt alſo bring forth the fruites of faith, which are good workes, &amp; that neceſſarilie, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to declare, and teſtifie his faith, as the Apoſtle <hi>Saint Iames</hi> doth fullie prooue. This neceſſarie coniunction of workes and faith, the effect and the cauſe, doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue, but that our apprehenſion of Chriſt is to be attributed to onelie faith:<note place="margin">Faithe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be alone yet it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth Chriſt, &amp; iuſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fieth alone.</note> as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of the light is the onely &amp; proper function of the eie, although the facultie of ſeeing cannot be deuided from the ſenſe of feeling. Yet no man will ſaie that we perceiue the brightnes of the ſunne by our
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:27710:99"/>feeling, but by our ſeeing onelie. So though our faith can neuer be alone, but is alwaies fruitfull of good workes, yet it onelie doth iuſtifye, and not good workes, in that it onelie laieth holde vpon Chriſt our righteouſnes. You haue a weake head <hi>Maſter Rainolds,</hi> if you ſtagger at this. But bleſſed be God, that ſtriketh his enimies thus with giddines.</p>
               <p>To like purpoſe ſerueth that you alledge out of <hi>Illyricus</hi> and others, concerning the controuerſy, <hi>whether good workes are neceſſarie to ſaluation.</hi> There is none ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, but knoweth the iudgement, and reſolution of the Church. And although <hi>Illyricus</hi> be earneſt,<note place="margin">How good workes are neceſſary: not as cauſes of ſaluation, but as effectes of a iuſtifiyng faith.</note> &amp; ſaieth, <hi>they are no way neceſſarie to ſaluation,</hi> yet he confeſſeth a faithfull man muſt needs doe them, as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties neceſſarilie required by the Lord: not that they are anie waies the cauſe or merite of ſaluation. If you vnderſtand the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition thus, then in this ſenſe they are not neceſſarie: for then ſhould they derogate from the merites of Chriſt. But as effectes of faith, and iuſtification, ſo are they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie: and this doctrine as it is true, ſo is it far from all papiſtrie. For papiſtes teach that workes are efficient cauſes of their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:27710:99"/>ſaluation, and that is moſte falſe, and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the blood of Chriſt: Chriſtians holde that good workes are neceſſarie fruites of faith, and that thoſe who are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and reconciled with God, muſt walke before him in new obedience, and ſerue him in righteouſnes and holines all their daies. You wiſh I were a Papiſt for mine owne ſake: and for your ſake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine I wiſh that you were none. Which of theſe wiſhes is better, the day of the Lord ſhall make manifeſt.

But as in all debating and triall of truth it is acounted an vnhoneſt part to deuiſe falſe ſhifts for maintenance of vntrueth,<note place="margin">The fathers in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings haue ſundry weeds growing with the good corne.</note> ſo in matters of Gods worſhip and Religion to vſe craftie cauillation is a moſt wicked and damnable practiſe. The auncient fathers holding the ground and foundation of doctrine, did oftentimes builde thereon ſtubble and ſtrawe, partlie by ſome ſuperſtitious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which themſelues conceiued of ſuch inuentions, and partlie by the ſway and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of cuſtome, whereby they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a liking of thoſe things, which they ſaw commended, and practiſed by others. And yet God forbid that becauſe of ſome errours which they held, we ſhould raze their names out of the Calender of Gods Saintes, or thinke otherwiſe then reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of them.</p>
               <p>Among other infections that raigned in the fathers daies, this was not the leaſte
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:27710:100"/>that they hoped in ſome ſort to make ſome parte of amendes to God for their ſinnes, by voluntarie puniſhments, which they ſuſtained in this life. Whereof although by a conſequent it followeth, that they did iniurie to the ſatisfaction of Chriſtes death, yet they meant not directlie to take anie thing from it, but truſted by it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be iuſtified and ſaued. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les being ledd by a likelie and probable perſuaſion of mans witt, that God would ſpare them, if they puniſhed them ſelues, they truſted by this meanes to make ſome recompenſe for their offenſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffered much hardnes, trauaile, and penaltie in the courſe of their life: which if they had done ſimplie with deſire and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thereby to make themſelues fitter for the ſeruice of God, it had bene a godly and profitable endeuour. And this no Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t miſliketh, ſeeing the Apoſtie hath taught, that it is expedient for all Chriſtians <hi>to beat downe and ſubdue their owne bodies.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.26.</note> But to put anie confidence of appeaſing Gods wrath in theſe actions deuiſed by them ſelues, cannot be excuſed in anie whoſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Howbeit I would not any ſhould thinke that when the Fathers ſpeake ſo often of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:27710:101"/>
                  <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Penance,</hi>

For thoſe <hi>ſatisfactions</hi> were nothing els, for the moſt parte, but penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties appointed by the Church, for ſuch to endure, as had by ſome open falling into greater tranſgreſſion giuen a publike of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe to the Church of Chriſt. Such were brought vnder penance by the cenſure &amp; diſcipline of the Church, which when they had accrodinglie performed, in token of their vnfained repentance, then were they receiued againe into the companie of the faithfull, and then was ſatisfaction made, namelie in reſpect of the Church. Of theſe Eccleſiaſticall ſatisfactions we reade often in the fathers and councels: but hereby is not meant that by theſe they purchaſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their ſinnes at the hands of God. And yet I denie not but manie did put too great ſuperſtition in theſe outward exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, truſting ſomething thereby to finde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with God, the rather for their harde vſage of themſelues. Which though it be an error, yet were they notwithſtanding good men, and holie fathers, as I called them.</p>
               <p>In which reſpect, when you labour and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:27710:101"/>ſpend much of your oyle, to prooue me contrarie to my ſelfe, you may ſee what a trifler you are, and how vnworthie of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. Were not the Apoſtles holie men,<note place="margin">Holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may haue &amp; had their errors, and that in weighty cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> when they dreamed of an earthlie king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in this world? yet this opinion is contrarie to a principal article of our faith. were they void of holines, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued that the goſpell was to be preached to the Iewes onelie? which is greatlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatorie to the grace of God, and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his people. Then euerie error doth not ouerthrowe all holines in the ſeruants of God. In the primitiue Church manie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie fathers were infected with the error of Chriſtes raigning a thouſand yeares on earth, who notwithſtanding are worthelie accounted Saints of God. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie godlie Byſhops with him erred about the baptiſme miniſtred by heretikes: yet loſt they not for all that the opinion and name of holie fathers. Thus the vanitie of your chalenge appeareth in finding fault with me, for calling the fathers holie, whome I charged with error: it being ſuch as in them did not raze the foundation of the goſpell.</p>
               <p>Your argument of the Church is friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:27710:102"/>True it is, that he that maketh a ſchiſme in the Church, and cutteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the ſame, cannot be ſaued. But to erre in this point as the fathers did, is neither ſchiſme, nor ſo dangerous to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ſchiſme. Nether is it like to the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the <hi>Galatians</hi> altogeather. For it was in the fathers only an ouerſight of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, by leaning ſomewhat too much to their owne reaſon, and not conſidering the matter ſo deepely as they ought: and yet they held not, that works are to be ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Chriſt, as neceſſary cauſes of our iuſtification and ſaluation, but aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the wholl work of our redemption vnto Chriſt, they erred a litle in applying this redemption vnto them-ſelues. Your caſe is the ſame that was of the <hi>Galatians.</hi> For as they thought to be iuſtified by the workes of the Law, ſo do you: as they were warned of their error, ſo are you: as they without repentance loſt the benefit of Chriſts ſacrifice, ſo ſhall you. Yf the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had bene as often &amp; plainlie admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as you haue bene, they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy and ſincere men, haue reformed their iudgement: and keeping the head, though they erred in ſome part, the Lord
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:27710:102"/>will not impute that error vnto them for condemnation.</p>
               <p>All that you alledge here out of that worthy ſeruant of Chriſt <hi>M. Luther,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 120. &amp;c</note> I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge for true, ſeeing it is the verie ſame that the Scriptures them-ſelues haue taught. For this is the voice and doctrine of the goſpell, that by faith onelie in the mediator, who by his ſacrifice once offered vpon the croſſe hath reconciled the father vnto vs, we are iuſtified and ſaued. Then to liue ſtraitlie, and to do good workes with this purpoſe and perſuaſion, that thereby we ſhall obtaine iuſtice or ſaluation, is contrary to the trueth of Chriſts goſpell, and may not in anie be allowed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though otherwiſe moſte learned and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Will you reaſon hereby againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and me, becauſe we charge the fathers with ſome ouerſight in the trueth of this doctrine, in that they thought ſomewhat too well of their owne deedes, we muſt therefore repute them for wicked men, and make them no better then Papiſts? They erred not ſomuch as you, they erred not ſo wilfully as you: and therefore though there beſome likenes betweene their error &amp; yours, yet we account not of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:27710:103"/>them, as of you, who beſides that you erre in this point of iuſtification moſt damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, haue alſo multiplied your errours in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther articles, &amp; almoſt left no one ground of pure religion vnſhaken. And therefore you greatlie deceiue your owne heart <hi>M. Rainolds,</hi> when you thinke your ſelfe to be in the ſame caſe that the fathers were in, becauſe ſometime the fathers gaue more to their works, then they ſhould haue done, you truſting to be iuſtified and ſaued by the worthines and merits of your workes, which the fathers did not. So betwene you and them there is a great ſpace of diſtance: although I graunt that ſome things which they haue written of this matter, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized in their liues, tendeth ſomewhat to your hereſie of iuſtification by workes. For the myſterie of iniquitie, which in papiſtry is fullie finiſhed, began to worke in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles age, &amp; ſo continued ſtill forward in the fathers daies, vntil it came to his height and perfection in the kingdome of popery. They ſlipt a litle, you are fallen headlong into the pit: they were ouerſeene through infirmitie, you are blinde of malice: they ſcattered ſome darnell in the Lords field, you haue plucked vp by the roots the good
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:27710:103"/>corne. They haue ſuffred loſſe of this buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, being not agreeable to the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet are ſaued: you ouerthrow the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation it ſelfe, and therefore cannot in this opinion be ſaued.</p>
               <p>The contradiction which you haue found in my wordes,<note place="margin">Pag. 124.</note> is a knott in a ruſh: your head is crazie, I perceiue, by your wandring and friuolous talke: or els your wit is often verie fugitiue. Although the fathers ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time doe require ſatisfaction by workes, not onelie in reſpect of the Church, but of God, as appeareth by <hi>Saint Cyprian</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in ſundry places, and therein haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured the doctrine of repentance and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, yet they neuer meant ſo groſlie,<note place="margin">Satiſfactions in reſpect of God, taught and practiſed in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue time, what they were.</note> as you doe, that this ſatisfaction of theirs ſhould be a worthie and ſufficient recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe to god, for their ſinnes committed againſt his moſte holie maieſtie: but that they ought to craue humblie for pardon at gods hands, by humbling themſelues be fore him in faſting, and praying, and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing their bodies in this life. This appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the 55. epiſtle of <hi>Saint Cyprian,</hi> as I noted:<note place="margin">Ne exoretur precib. &amp; ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factionibus.</note> who ſpeaking of Chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Idolatrie, ſaith, <hi>They make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, that Chriſt may not be intreated by
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:27710:104"/>praiers and ſatisfactions.</hi> This godlie father aſcribeth remiſſion of ſinnes to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Chriſt, being intreated <hi>by praiers and ſatisfactions.</hi> If remiſſion be of pardon, then is it not of ſatisfaction, as you meane: if it be obtained by praiers, then is it not giuen to the worthines of our workes. Againe he ſaieth, <hi>I imbrace with readie and perfecte loue, ſuch as returne with repentance, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſinnes with humble and ſimple ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Satisfactione humili &amp; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice.</note> What els doth he meane by this humble ſatisfaction, but humble and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſupplication for pardon? in his booke againſt <hi>Demetrian</hi> he ſaith, ſpeaking to the heathen, <hi>we exhort while there is leaue, that you ſatisfie God.</hi> And can the workes of ſuch men make a full ſatisfaction vnto God? No: But <hi>Saint Cyprian</hi> expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe by &amp; by in theſe words: <hi>Thou euen at thy howre of death, and end of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life, intreate God for thy ſinnes, who is one &amp; true: pardon is giuen to him that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and to him that beleeueth, gratious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is graunted of Gods mercie.</hi> Thus with this godlie father, to ſatisfie God, is to make humble ſute and requeſt to God for our ſinnes:<note place="margin">Salutaris in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgentia.</note> and gratious or <hi>ſauing indulgence</hi> is the effecte of this ſatisfaction.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:27710:104"/>Although their meaing was nothing ſo corrupte as yours, yea for the moſte parte was ſincere, yet the maner of doctrine is vnſound, in that our ſatisfaction is required as neceſſarie, whereas Chriſt hath already made a ful ſatisfaction for vs: and by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion hereof it grewe in time to be an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion receiued of the moſte, that theſe ſatisfactions did in ſome part appeaſe the wrath of almightie God, and deſerue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which is contraie to the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. Where is now that contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>M. Rainolds,</hi> which you imagined? looke better what you ſaie, or els we may worthelie thinke your dealing is verie childiſh, &amp; vndiſcrete, &amp; nothing ſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for a ſober man, or learned diuine.</p>
               <p>But litle hope is there of more honeſt dealing at your hands, who as may ſeeme,<note place="margin">Pag. 127.</note> haue hardened your face againſt the truth, &amp; ſet your ſelfe wilfullie in the chaire of ſcorners and ſlaunderers.<note place="margin">Foule ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phemies vtte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red by M.R. againſt the trueth of Chriſtes goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> For your railing at our doctrine of <hi>onelie faith,</hi> is too impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as though it leaft no place for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing of ſinnes, for faſting, for praying, for watching, for giuing almes, for doing good workes: yea you call <hi>onelie faith, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie fanſie, and imagination.</hi> You were a verie
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:27710:105"/>euill ſcholler in our ſchole, who in all the time you taried amongſt vs, and had the charge alſo of a Church committed vnto you, did no better learne the doctrine of iuſtification by faith alone, then thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trulie, and blaſphemouſlie to reporte of it. Doth faith exclude good workes, becauſe it alone doth receiue &amp; embrace Ieſus Chriſt our ſauiour and redeemer? is the faith of Chriſtians, whereby alone Chriſt is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and applied vnto them, no better then a vaine imagination and fanſie? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente M.

               <p>Now that you bring againſt me, to prooue vs to be Miniſters of Antichriſt,<note place="margin">pag. 128.</note> by the ſame reaſon that we prooue you to be prieſts of Antichriſt, let vs in a word conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the force of it. I ſaie, that ſeeing of Chriſts prieſthoode there be two parts, the one to offer a ſacrifice once for all, the other to make interceſſion for vs, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ouerthrowe both, in that they teach that Chriſt is offered dailie, &amp; that there be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:27710:105"/>innumerable Mediatours. <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> ſaieth, <hi>If they be Antichriſts for offering ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, we alſo are Antichriſts for praying: for ſo much as the one belongeth to his Prieſthood, as well as the other.</hi> A blinde and witles cauill. They pretend to offer a ſacrifice, no leſſe then Chriſt himſelfe, to make attonement betwixt god &amp; man.<note place="margin">An ignorant &amp; vnlearned obiection of M.R. refuted.</note> This ſacrifice is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alreadie by Chriſt, and neuer muſt nor can be offered againe: and therefore they are indeed Antichriſts, in denying the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie abſolute ſacrifice of Chriſt. Againe in appointing ſo manie Mediatours, by whoſe interceſſion they may be brought into Gods fauour, they doe open iniurie to the other part of his prieſthood, which is to offer praiers for vs, that by the worthines &amp; acceptation thereof, we may be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with God Doe we praie in this maner, that for the vertue and merits of our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, God would be gratious vnto vs, and to others?

                  <hi>M. Rainolds,</hi> that I will ſeeme to vpholde the chalenge, which that learned and godly Biſhop of <hi>Sariſbury, M. Iewell,</hi> did once make againſt your ſide. But as the authour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, while he liued, maintained the ſame moſt truelie &amp; worthelie againſt your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo I haue no cauſe to be afraid of anie thing, that can be alleadged in diſproofe of it, by you, or your companions, who may not rightlie be compared with <hi>D.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:27710:106"/>chalenge, which you haue ſo long agoe giuen ouer, as a deſperat cauſe, wherein the chiefeſt aduerſarie could not make ſhewe of proofe, without vſing the teſtimonies of forged &amp; counterfeite writers, as <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lochius, Clemens, Abdias, Hippolytus,</hi> and ſuch others, whereof no more accounte is to be made, then of fables, and ſhameles forgeries. Such were the chiefeſt proofes, which <hi>D. Harding</hi> was able to bring, and whatſoeuer he brought, hath bene fullie anſwered in the <hi>Replie</hi> by the Biſhop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: which booke as yet though it hath bene in ſome parts nipped at by diuers, yet throughlie confuted was it neuer. What you can doe in this caſe maie eaſilie be geaſſed: &amp; God knoweth, full litle haue you done to any purpoſe, as ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p>Your beginning is of an other matter.<note place="margin">Pag. 130. &amp;c.</note> For this queſtion <hi>of Peters being at Rome, M. Iewell</hi> made not anie parte of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, knowing well enough, that this might eaſelie be prooued by teſtimonie of fathers a greate manie. And this was I not ignorant of neither, when I ſaid, that no Papiſt can prooue, that Peter indeede was at <hi>Rome.</hi> For albeit I know that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe haue ſo written, ſince the Apoſtles
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:27710:107"/>times, yet can I not receaue this as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofe, neither yet ought you, there being againſt it ſo manie reaſons out of ſcripture,<note place="margin">All Popiſh re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon a twine threed of Perers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; ſitting at Rome: which can not be proo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued by the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note> whereof euerie one hath more weight, then all the teſtimonies of fathers alledged. You know, and can not denie that your wholl Church &amp; religion is built vpon Peters ſitting at <hi>Rome:</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter of ſuch conſequence, as that the wholl is vpholden, and ſuſtained ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uppon, ſo as if it ſhake, all is in danger, if it fal, al is cleane ouerthrowen: it ought to be made manifeſt to al Chriſtians, that <hi>Peter</hi> was at Rome, by greater proofe and warrant, then is in the writings of men, which being as good as anie of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be afforded, is not of ſufficient ſtrength to ſtay the conſcience deſirous to be ſoundlie and perfectly reſolued in points of faith and religion: but now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being by ſundry teſtimonies of holie ſcriptures vtterly diſcredited, it muſt be thought that they haue ſmall conſcience of truth, or regard of their euerlaſting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, that hang the ſaluation of their ſouls vpon ſo vncertaine and rotten a ſtay. The firſt reporter of <hi>Peters</hi> being at Rome was <hi>Papias,</hi> a man of mean credit &amp; authority
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:27710:107"/>in the Church of God,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. <hi>3.</hi> ca. <hi>39.</hi>
                  </note> and as <hi>Euſebius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of him, a father of diuerſe fables: a fit father of your faith. Of him <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued this, and of <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> others, as in writing hiſtories the latter follow thoſe that went before: ſo that this wholl mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is grounded vppon <hi>Papias</hi> word, for which your pope hath good cauſe to giue him thankes. Now the ſcriptures in many places weigh ſo ſtrongly on the other ſide, that if manie a thouſand ſuch as <hi>Papias</hi> ſhould tell vs <hi>Peter</hi> was at Rome, their reporte were not to be truſted. <hi>Peter</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to remaine with the Iewes,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.9.</note> and be their Apoſtle: and <hi>Paul</hi> aſſigneth vnto him the Apoſtleſhip of the circumciſion.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.8.</note> If <hi>Peter</hi> were Biſhop of Rome, how was this promiſe kept? Saint Paul writeth an epiſtle to the Romanes, wherin he ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth many perſons by name, but of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> he maketh no mention: and from Rome he writeth manie epiſtles at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times, and ſendeth ſalutations to the Churches from many faithful, but of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in none he ſpeaketh euer a word. Doubtles it was becauſe Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was not there.<note place="margin">Genebr. Chre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:27710:108"/>yeares almoſt, it may be thought ſtraunge how it could come to paſſe, that when Saint Paull writ to Rome, and came him ſelfe to Rome, and taried at Rome, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from thence ſo manie epiſtles, S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould euer be abſent for his charge.</p>
               <p>Other arguments might I vſe againſt this common opinion of <hi>Peters</hi> ſitting and dying at Rome. But as you loſe all, if you can not prooue him to haue bene Biſhop there, ſo though you could prooue it, and we ſhould of neceſſitie confeſſe it, yet had you gained nothing at all. For though it muſt nedes follow if <hi>Peter</hi> were not Biſhop of Rome, that all your religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is falſe flowing from that head, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graunted that <hi>Peter</hi> had bene Biſhop there, it maketh neither hotte nor colde for proofe of anie point in queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs.<note place="margin">pag. 133. <hi>Liui. decad.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 5.</note> Of this therfore no more now.</p>
               <p>The largenes of the chalenge contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in number ſeauen and twentie articles of controuerſie, you labour to extenuate, by an old hiſtorie recorded in <hi>Liuie</hi> of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Falminius</hi> hoſt, who by diuerſe maners of dreſſing and preparing one onely kinde of meate, furniſhed his table with great varietie of diſhes. And would
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:27710:108"/>you beare vs downe, <hi>Maſter Rainolds,</hi> that this multitude of articles is but of one matter, drawne forth into ſundrie partes, by skilful varying and mincing the ſame? If anie will looke vpon them, he ſhall ſoone be hable to controll you. The firſt <hi>of Priuate maſſe,</hi> the ſecond <hi>of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in one kinde,</hi> the third <hi>of common praiers in an vnknowen tongue,</hi> the fourth <hi>of the Popes ſupremacy,</hi> the fift <hi>of the reall preſence,</hi> the ſeuenth <hi>of eleuation,</hi> the eight <hi>of Adoration,</hi> the ninthe <hi>of Hanging the Sacrament vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Canopy,</hi> the tenth <hi>of Accidents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſubiect,</hi> the fourtenth <hi>of worſhiping Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> the fiftenth <hi>of reading the ſcriptures in the vulgar tongue,</hi> the ſeauententh <hi>of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the maſſe:</hi> can you denie that theſe controuerſies, being the arguments of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall articles, are diuerſe and differing one from an other? And are not theſe waightie pointes, generall heads, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall queſtions, <hi>great miſteries, and keies,</hi> as <hi>Maſter Iewel</hi> calleth them, of your religion? ſome of the other articles (I graunt) haue more affinitie together, yet not ſo great, except in one or two, but that they maie in reaſon and nature be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, and ſtand each by them
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:27710:109"/>ſelues without neceſſarie ſupport or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe, from others. And what though there had bene a nearer reſpect betweene them, might they not therefore be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and handled ſeuerally? The manner of your owne ſchooles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie lectures, prooue the contrarie, wherin euerie queſtion according to the ſubiect matter is deuided into ſundrie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and euerie article hath a ſpecial trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſe. Your tale therefore of the <hi>Calcidian</hi> hoſte, who entertained the Romane Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine with one onely kinde of meat dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed diuerſly, commendeth the cunning of that cooke, but ſerueth nothing to your purpoſe, though you ſet it out with as great ſhew as you can.</p>
               <p>Three articles you acknowledge to be of weight,<note place="margin">pag. 138.</note> 
                  <hi>The primacy of the Pope, thereall preſence, and the ſacrifice:</hi> wherein you haue vttered your iudgement of the reſt, that they are not of ſuch weight as your Church would haue them to be eſteemed. And of theſe three you might with as good reaſon except the two latter, &amp; ſo make the firſt onely a matter of weight. For that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is the ſubſtantiall point, in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance wherof all your labours are beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:27710:109"/>Otherwiſe were it not for defenſe of your Popes wicked, vnreaſonable, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian monarchy, you could eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with vs for theſe two, &amp; all the reſt, I doubt not. But what thinke you then <hi>M. R.</hi> of <hi>priuat Maſſe?</hi> Is it a thing of no weight as here you would haue it accounted? there is not, I ſuppoſe, any thing in your Church more vſed, or better liked. Your halfe communion, your latine ſeruice, your I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, your keeping the ſcriptures in a tongue vnknowen to the people, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch heads of your Romiſh religion, are they of no weight? are they trifles? are they not worth the ſtriuing for? Then let your men giue ouer all defenſe of them, let priuate maſſes be aboliſhed, let the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion be adminiſtred in bothe kindes, according to Chriſts inſtitution, let the publike praiers be ſaid in the tongue that euery country vſeth, let Images be burned and Idolatrie forbidden, let it be lawfull for the people of all countries to read the ſcriptures in their owne language, let there be no controuerſie about the other articles. For while you ſtand ſo ſtifly in maintenance of all theſe and others, you cannot truely ſaie, and beare vs in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:27710:110"/>hand, they are not of waight in your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Maſter Iewell</hi> promiſed to giue ouer and ſubſcribe,<note place="margin">Pag. 140.</note> if anie of thoſe articles could be prooued by ſcriptures, councels, or Doctors, within 600. yeares after Chriſt, it was not becauſe he meant euer to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to your doctrine, or was vnſtaied in his religion, but of a moſt aſſured know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and reſolute perſuaſion that you were vtterlie deſtitute in this behalfe of all truth and antiquitie, as indeed you are. Otherwiſe you maie remember that our religion is grounded onelie vpon the holy ſcriptures of God: and therefore though you brought againſt vs writers and fathers neuer ſo manie for theſe matters, as you can bring not one of credite and age, yet will we neuer ſubſcribe vnto you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing once ſubſcribed to the certaine tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of God reuealed vnto vs in his holie, perfect, &amp; written word, by which al ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, opinions, and writings of men whatſoeuer, muſt be examined.</p>
               <p>Now commeth <hi>M. Rainolds</hi> to auouch the truth of theſe three notable articles,<note place="margin">pag. 142. &amp;c.</note> out of auncient writers againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Sariſburies</hi> chalenge: &amp; firſt <hi>of the Popes

And though it were, what matter maketh it for your purpoſe? A generall councell muſt haue a preſident: which preſidencie if it were graunted to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in reſpecte of his place, which was the firſt amongſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, will you of your wiſdome hereof gather, that he was <hi>

All Biſhops were bound to maintaine and approoue the godly decrees of councells, that ſo hereſies might be repreſſed, and the puritie of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion preſerued. Is it then a great maruell, if the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that was accounted firſt and chiefe, confirmed good councels, and diſanulled wicked? whoe is he that hath the reaſon of a man, that will hereof conclude in ſadnes and ſobriety the popes ſupremacy?

                  <hi>which the holy ghoſt hath left at large.</hi> If this be ſo, then hath your vulgare interpreter bene ouer ſaucy and malapert often times. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſuch ſaucines I might alledge many in his tranſlation, if cauſe required. I graunt a man cannot be too preciſe, and religious in tranſlating the wordes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcripture: and that it ought to be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall care of a godly tranſlator, neither to reſtraine, nor enlarge any thing, as farre forth as he may performe by skill and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: for ſo much as the text may afford a doctrine, ſometime in his original and naturall wordes, which by altering in the tranſlation is ſoone marred. But theſe admitt no other ſenſe, then one; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no matter whether a man ſay, that <hi>heauen muſt receiue Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt muſt be receiued in heauen;</hi> the meaning is all one. For as for the conceite of ſome, which you affirme may perhappes be true, that Chriſt ſhould receiue heauen, it paſſeth al
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:27710:120"/>compaſſe of reaſon or diuinitie. Howe, I pray you, doth Chriſt receiue heauen? by his diuine power? but the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of Chriſts aſcenſion, as in the text ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, and all interpreters vnderſtande the wordes: how then doth Chriſt receiue heauen in his humanitie, wherein he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh? tell vs if you can.

Your ſecond &amp; third points, where in you vrge and proſecute <hi>M.

That <hi>Illyricus</hi> is not contented
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:27710:120"/>with this tranſlation, what maruel, ſeeing he wil haue Chriſts body contayned in no place? If you be of his iudgement, you may vſe his authoritie againſt <hi>Beza</hi> herein.

Of Atheiſme and infidelitie take heede your ſelfe, <hi>M. R</hi> you haue alreadie made a dangerous ſtep.<note place="margin">The papiſts to prooue their Reall preſence are faine to flee to Gods om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie, and thus to argue: god is able to make his body Reallie pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent in the ſacrament, therefore ſo he doth.</note> God forbid I ſhould be guiltie of that ſin, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you do without all conſcience or reaſon accuſe me. God is omnipotent, and euer was, and euer wilbe. But his omnipotency prooueth not your <hi>Reall preſence.</hi> For haue you learned to conclude, that ſeing God is omnipotent, and hath power to doe all things, therefore he doth al things, yea of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth violence to his owne body for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of your abſurd &amp; hereticall aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? muſt Gods omnipotency attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your fanſies? Cannot god be omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, vnles your real preſence be graunted? No ſuch matter, thankes be to God: &amp; ſo your accuſation of infidelitie is vaine and childiſh. Albeit I ſuppoſe you are not igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rant altogether of your owne ſcholaſtical doctrine concerning Gods omnipotency.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:27710:122"/>Your ſchoolemen teach that <hi>God cannot do any thing wherein a contradiction is implied:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thom. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>25.</hi> q. <hi>3.</hi> art.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; that all other things he can doe, and therefore is omnipotent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The popiſh ſchoolemen confute the popiſh fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie of Reall preſence.</note> But herein a manifeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is implied, that Chriſts body ſhould be viſible and inuiſible togeather, that it is compaſſed and circumſcribed in one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place, and that alſo it is contained in an infinite number of ſacraments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any circumſcription of place. And thus your owne ſchoolemen teaching, and that trulie, that god cannot doe any thing, wherein is included a contradiction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot lie, haue in deede grounde to powder your conceit of Real preſence, which without moſte cleare contradiction can neuer be maintained. For if Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be viſible, how is it then inuiſible? If Chriſts body haue all properties of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body, whereof this is one, &amp; that moſte neceſſary &amp; inſeperable, to be contained and circumſcribed in one certaine place: how can it then be true that his body is in infinite places without any circumſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all? Neuer deny for ſhame, but if there be in the world anie contradiction, this is one. And yet here <hi>Maſter Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> taketh in hand to prooue contrary to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:27710:123"/>the doctrine of their owne ſchooles,<note place="margin">M.R. goeth about to prooue that God can make two contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions true.</note> that God worketh as flat contradictories, as this: then which none can be deuiſed more flat. But theſe examples, <hi>Maſter Rainolds,</hi> which you bring, are nothing like this, whereof I ſpeake.</p>
               <p>For concerning the holie virgins birth, therein is no contradiction. There was a miracle indeed, that a virgine ſhould beare a ſonne contrarie to the courſe of nature. For to be a virgine, &amp; yet to haue a childe, are not contradictorie, if ſhe haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and brought forth by miracle, as did the bleſſed virgine:<note place="margin">M.R. obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe.</note> but to be a virgine, &amp; not a virgine at once, this is the contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. So for Chriſts bodie to be viſible &amp; inuiſible, locall and not locall at once, is in euerie reſpect the like contradiction: and therefore impoſſible to be true.</p>
               <p>Your other example of Chriſts entring in, the dores being ſhut, what ſhewe of contradiction hath it? Can you prooue he entred through the dores? and if he did, then was there an alteration of qualities, &amp; that by miracle, either in Chriſts bodie, or in the dores, but no contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in nature: vnles you know not what is a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Your third and laſt example of the fire
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:27710:123"/>in <hi>Nabucadnezars</hi> ouen, which conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Miniſters, but hurt not thoſe that were in the middeſt of it, appeereth to be of no waight, by that hath alreadie bene anſwered. You imagine belike that in euerie miracle a contradiction is implied: which is abſurde. If you can prooue that this fire was both hot and colde, then you ſaie ſomething to the purpoſe: but that it burnt vp ſome, and hurt not others, is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction, becauſe by miracle the force thereof was repreſſed. Thus are you truly and fullie anſwered to your ſimple ſophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: and your Real preſence is diſprooued by the eternall lawe of God in nature, wherevnto he hath euen bound himſelfe, neuer to doe anie thing, wherein there is a contradiction to be found, as your owne Diuines haue wel and truelie taught. Then may you ſee that my argument was not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Euclide,</hi> as you ſaie, but is grounded vpon the eternall decree, and moſte vnchangeable trueth of God: to which your Real preſence muſt giue place, being nothing els, but an irreligious and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictorius deuiſe of your owne braine.<note place="margin">Pag. 185.</note>
               </p>
               <p>By this is anſwered that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, wherin are alledged certaine miracles,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:27710:124"/>vainly &amp; altogether from the purpoſe. The queſtion is not, whether is more repugnant to nature, to be borne of a virgine, or a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to be incircumſcript (although herein you ſpeake without reaſon or authoritie) but whether it be either agreeable to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Gods wil, that one &amp; the ſelfe ſame bodie be at once <hi>circumſcript</hi> and <hi>incircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript,</hi> as you defend Chriſts bodie to be.</p>
               <p>Firſt you ſaie <hi>the bodie of our ſauiour Chriſt was incircumſcript in his natiuitie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. R. affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes of Chriſts body.</note> 
                  <hi>reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; aſcenſion.</hi> Although this be moſte falſe and hereticall, deſtroying the trueth of Chriſts humanitie, yet if it were graunted, it argueth nothing, vnleſſe you will ſaie, that when it was incircumſcript, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo circumſcript, as now you affirme of the ſame bodie: for you confeſſe his body is circumſcript, and yet you ſay the ſelfe ſame bodie is incircumſcript: and herein is an euident contradiction, which when you labour to defend, what do you els, but with intollerable boldenes maintaine moſte monſtrous abſurdities?</p>
               <p>Likewiſe <hi>S. Peters</hi> bodie you ſaie was incircumſcript, by <hi>Paulinus</hi> authoritie, who ſaieth <hi>S. Peter</hi> came out of the priſon being ſhut. And meant <hi>Paulinus,</hi> that <hi>Saint Peter</hi> came through the walls or dores of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:27710:124"/>the priſon? ſo ſaith not the ſcripture. If the yron gate opened of it owne accord vnto him, why alſo might not the dores of the priſon open, and giue place vnto him?</p>
               <p>Secondlie you ſaie, <hi>Chriſts bodie was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, when he paſſed through the midſt of them, that would haue caſt him downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from the hill.</hi> This is more then you learned in the text.<note place="margin">Luc. 4.30.</note> The ſcripture ſaith that <hi>he paſſed through the middeſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> But not, that he paſſed inuiſiblie.

               <p>The argument that is grounded onelie vpon reaſon, in matters of Religion and faith, we graunt moſte vnfainedlie to be no lawfull weapon in the Lords warfare. And therefore whatſoeuer they haue ſaid againſt Philoſophie and reaſon,<note place="margin">Arguments taken from reaſon in mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion what force they haue.</note> when it diſagreeth from the faith, which in the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we learne, all that we allow with all our heartes, and neuer vſed thus anie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument taken from naturall reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt either you, or <hi>Luther.</hi> For reaſon
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:27710:127"/>muſt ſubmit it ſelfe to faith we know, faith muſt not be reſtrained or ſtretched accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reaſon. But when reaſon in not controlled of faith, then I thinke you will not ſay, but an argument builded vpon reaſon maketh a neceſſary proofe. Now in this matter faith and reaſon are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: no faith teacheth that Chriſts body is without the properties of a true body: al reaſon prooueth, that if Chriſt haue a true body, as he hath, then his body is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with natural qualities and properties of a body. Reaſoning againſt this ſound &amp; immutable reaſon, you plainely ſhew your ſelues to be void of reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now that one and the ſame body (as Chriſt hath but one onely body) ſhould be at once of contradictory diſpoſitions, as namely both viſible, and inuiſible, both in a certaine place, &amp; in no certaine place, as you teach, and boldly, but moſte vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintaine, this is contrary not onely to reaſon, but alſo to faith, which teacheth that God cannot lie, and therefore neuer can make two <hi>contradictories</hi> true; for in the one alwaies an vntruth of neceſſitie reſteth. As for example, if Chriſts body be alwaies viſible and circumſcripte, then is
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:27710:127"/>it a manifeſtlie, to ſay, the ſame body is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible and incircumſcripte: but Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is alwaies both viſible &amp; circumſcripte: and therefore in ſaying his body is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible and incircumſcripte, you cannot be excuſed from vntruth and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In faith is no contradiction: in your aſſertion there is a foule and palpable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: wherefore your aſſertion is not of faith. If I had to deale with <hi>Weſtphalus</hi> or <hi>Illyricus,</hi> further would I anſwere there ſpeaches: but as you make them here to ſerue your purpoſe, I haue not any more to ſay vnto them.

Your ſpitefull repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches caſt againſt him &amp; others are now of all eſteemed, as they are in truth, fained &amp; ſlaunderous, vnworthie of anie regard or credit.

His <hi>skill in murthering men,</hi> you ſaie, was better, which argueth you haue no conſcience to deuiſe to ſpeake, to write, moſte vntrulie.

               <p>The words are in Luke. 22. v. 20. which in the Greeke that <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlated, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction indeed require, tha the cuppe, which is called the new Teſtament, ſhould be ſhed for vs. In which reſpect <hi>Beza</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlateth

I ſee you are a reſolute man: continew thus a while, and I nothing doubt, but he whoſe ordinance and ſacrament you haue thus boldelie and wickedly blaſphemed, wilbe auenged vpon that profane heart and tongue of yours. But let vs heare what you ſaie.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">pag. 239.</note> whereas I ſaid if they vnderſtand by the cuppe, the bloode in the cuppe, as they doe, then is there mention made of double bloode; you tell me, <hi>I lie groſlie and intollerablie:</hi> ſuch curteous ſpeaches I haue no cauſe to thanke you for: but let all men of wiſdome be iudges, whether I haue not ſaied the truth. Thus you make <hi>S. Luke</hi> to ſpeake, this cup, that is, this bloode, is the new Teſtament in my blood, which is ſhed for you. Is not here by your conſtruction
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:27710:139"/>mentioned firſt one blood, then an other? your reply is pitifull <hi>M.

And is it all one to ſay, This blood is the blood of the new teſtament, and, this blood is the new teſtament in my blood? If it may be lawfull for you, to alter and expound the words at your pleaſure, then can you help your ſelfes wel enough: but your expoſition muſt be ſquared ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wordes, not the words fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to your expoſition.</p>

The words are right, your expoſition is fond and wicked. The cupp you make to be the blood of Chriſt, whoe as yet was not crucified, nor his blood ſhed. If your doctrine be true, Chriſtes blood was ſhed alreadie, and that reallie: els it could not be in the cup reallie.<note place="margin">The papiſts teache that Chriſts blood was reallie in the cup be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> But if Chriſts blood was ſhed ſitting at the table, whoe was he, <hi>M.R.</hi> that ſhed it? whoe made the wound? whoe opened his ſide? who thruſt his weapon in his heart? whoe pearced his hands and feete? This muſt you tell, if you maintaine that his blood was then reallie ſhed, and powred forth into the cuppe. But by the cuppe <hi>M.R.</hi> is ment the wine in the cuppe, which is the newe teſtament, that is a ſacrament of the newe teſtament in Chriſts blood ſhed for vs on the croſſe. This is a true and plaine ſenſe, agreeable to all analogie of faith, ſtanding with the words themſelues, followed of the auncient fathers.</p>
               <p>When at length will you make an end of this railing? it is to vnſeemelie, to lothſome,<note place="margin">pag. 241.</note> to odious: Indeed <hi>M.R.</hi> it muſt needes appeare a great abſurditie to all learned &amp;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:27710:140"/>godly Chriſtians, whoe know &amp; rightlie eſteeme the price of our redemption, <hi>that to be ſhed for our ſinnes, which was in the cup.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Chriſts blood was ſhed for our ſinnes; which neuer came in the cup, but remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his bodie, vntil the time of his death. And if Chriſts blood was in the cuppe, when he gaue the cuppe to his Apoſtles, then muſt it follow neceſſarilie, that his bodie then was without blood, it being ſhedde already, and contained in the cup. In the cuppe was onelie wine, a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his blood, which he gaue in the ſame to his Apoſtles to drincke, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he drancke him ſelfe: and ſo the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures expreſſely call it wine. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If this were the thing that was ſhedde for your ſinnes, then was true and naturall wine the price of your redemption: then are you ſaued by wine: then haue you no part in Chriſts blood. But the true Church beleeueth her ſinnes to be waſhed away, not by that which was really contained in the cuppe, but by the true blood of Chriſt, which iſſued out of his body nailed on the croſſe, and wounded with a ſpeare. Your abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie therefore needeth not to be further diſcouered: it is ſo openlie blaſphemous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:27710:140"/>the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, which was ſhed once, not in the cup, but on the croſſe, for our redemption.</p>
               <p>If you vrge <hi>S. Lukes</hi> words, as they ſtand in grammaticall conſtruction, I anſwere that as the cup is called Chriſts blood, &amp; Chriſts teſtament, that is by a figure, the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his blood and teſtament, ſo is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſaid to be ſhed for vs, by a figure, ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentallie.

                  <hi>Trente</hi> decreede. Admit this were true, that you entend here to prooue, doth it follow therefore that the Latine Bible is wholly to be preferred before the Hebrew &amp; Greeke?<note place="margin">Though the hebrew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdlie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that you decline not from the Greeke, or Hebrewe, becauſe it more harmeth your cauſe then the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, but for other cauſes. Whatſoeuer <hi>Gregorie Martine,</hi> to whome you referre your ſelfe, hath written of theſe points, it hath beene alreadie confuted, and yet ſtandeth confuted; and therefore no
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:27710:148"/>more needeth to be anſwered. What cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes moued you to preferre the latine before the Hebrew or Greeke, it ſhall appeare in place: reaſons I know are rendred in the preface of your tranſlation by your <hi>Remiſh</hi> tranſlatours, but ſuch as any man of skil and knowledge maie eaſilie eſpie to be ſimple ſhiftes and pretences onelie to ridde your ſelues from the originall text of ſcripture,<note place="margin">The papiſts condemne the Originall text and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe that ſerueth their turne nothing ſo wel in ſhew as this.</note> which is far more expreſſe and pregnant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your doctrines then the latine tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.

               <p>In the 14. Chapter of S.

               <p> Epheſians Chapter. 2. verſ. 10. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the Greeke writeth that <hi>we are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Chriſt vnto good workes:</hi> you tranſlate after your latine, <hi>in good workes.</hi> This cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is aduantage to your doctrine of good workes.</p>
               <p>In the ſame epiſtle Chapter. 5. verſ. 32. you translate <hi>this is a great ſacrament,</hi> to make men think that the ſcriptures affirme mariage to be a ſacrament of the Church: whereas if you had truelie translated it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Greeke, <hi>This is a great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> the occaſion of that ſurmiſe had bene remoued. In the epiſt. to the <hi>Pihl.</hi> Chap. 1. v. 27. the greeke word, which ſignifieth a ſigne, or token, or proofe, is in your latine vulgare translated <hi>a cauſe:</hi> and this transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do you keepe, the rather thereby to induce your readers to beleeue, that as the malitious dealing of wicked aduerſaries againſt the godlie maie truelie be ſaid to be the cauſe of their perdition, ſo likewiſe the patience of the godlie is a cauſe of their ſaluation: whereas the Apoſtle onelie ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this place, that the raging of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt the Church is a manifeſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of their condemnation, and the conſtant ſuffering of the godly is a certaine
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:27710:149"/>ſigne and teſtimony of their ſaluation, who ſeeth not herein what cauſe you had to like better of the latine tranſlation, then of the originall text?</p>
               <p>Luke Chap. 10. v. 35. the words are in the Greeke, <hi>whatſoeuer thou ſpendeſt more:</hi> which you tranſlate, <hi>whatſoeuer thou ſhalt ſupererogate.</hi> This corruption maketh ſome ſhewe for your workes of ſupererogation.</p>
               <p>Luke Chap. 1. v. 48. the bleſſed virgine ſaith, <hi>God hath looked on the lowe eſtate of his handmaid:</hi> you tranſlate, <hi>the humilitie of his handmaid.</hi> This corruption helpeth your doctrine of merites. So an other corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſame Chapter, v. 28. tending to the ſame purpoſe, where you haue tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, <hi>Haile full of grace:</hi> the Greeke and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall texte hath onelie, <hi>Haile thou freelie beloued.</hi> In the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, chap. 13. v. 16. you tranſlate, <hi>with ſuch hoſtes god is promerited:</hi> which is both a fonde and falſe tranſlation, the Greeke words being, <hi>with ſuch ſacrifices God is delighted,</hi> meaning almes and diſtribution.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Ep. of S. Peter Chap. 1. v. 15. you haue ſtrangely tranſlated the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words, <hi>I will doe my diligence, you to haue often after my deceaſe alſo, that you may keepe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:27710:149"/>a memorie of theſe thinges,</hi> and vpon this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered tranſlation you haue made a long note of Peters care and protection of the Church after his death: whereas the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in his owne wordes ſaith no more, but that he would <hi>endeuour dailie, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo might haue remembrance of thoſe things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his departure.</hi> A pretie ſleight in tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for aduantage, where the Apoſtle ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he would endeuour that they might remember thoſe thinges after his deceaſe, to make him ſaie, that he would haue them in remembrance after his deceaſe; and then of this falſe tranſlation to note what a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorall care S. Peter hath for the Church after he was deceaſed. In the epiſtle of S. Paule to the Romanes chap. 11. v. 6. the common tranſlator hath left out this whol ſentence together, <hi>But if it be of workes, it is no more grace: or els were worke no more worke:</hi> and theſe wordes haue you alſo in your Engliſh tranſlation cleane omitted, as though they were no parte of ſcripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtles vndouted words no leſſe, then the other that went before. What cauſe was there of this dealing, but onelie to ſmother that cleere oppoſition between merite and grace, which the Apoſtle hath
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:27710:150"/>in his owne words declared, if he might be ſuffered to ſpeake all.</p>
               <p>A number ſuch places could I alledge, where the vulgar tranſlation, differing and ſwaruing from the vndoubted originall text, is by you followed, becauſe it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth ſome ſound and ſhewe of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and errors. Manie excuſes may you make for your ſelues, &amp; your tranſlatours haue in their preface handſomely laid out their excuſes, (which I doubt not ſhal be weied and examined throughlie) but ſoone may anie man perceiue, what cauſe indeede moued you to be ſo friendlie to the tranſlation, and ſoe harde to the text: becauſe the texte doth plainlie diſcouer your nakednes, the tranſlation bringeth ſome ſmall ragges to hide it.</p>
               <p>Before you anſwere my arguments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for defenſe of the Hebrewe and Greeke texte,<note place="margin">pag. 285.</note> you ſet downe certaine words of mine, wherein I ſeeme (you ſay) to auouch, that onelie to be the worde of God, which is written in the language, wherein firſt the holie ghoſt by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles vttered it.<note place="margin">No cauill ſo ſimple which M.R. will not vſe.</note> My words are plaine, <hi>Maſter Rainolds,</hi> my meaning cannot ſeeme ambiguous: you ſeeke not
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:27710:150"/>for truth, but for a cauill. The word of God I know maie be vttered in other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, then wherein firſt it was by writing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to the Church: and tranſlations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with the originall texte are the word of God. For Gods worde is not the language, but the doctrine. Howbeit tranſlations ſet forthe by ſundrie perſons are ſo farre forth onelie the word of God, as they faithfully expreſſe the meaning of the Authenticall text, the which being written by the Prophets and Apoſtles, choſen inſtruments for that purpoſe, is wholly and vndoubtedlie the worde of God. Then it may worthelie be wondered at in you, whoe taking vpon you to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the new teſtament into engliſhe, haue not tranſlated the text of the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts, but the tranſlation of <hi>S. Ierome</hi> or ſome other, you know not whome: which tranſlation in verie manie places is corrupte, and therefore in thoſe places cannot be the word of God. Religion and reaſon would haue required that in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the ſcriptures you ſhould haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the originall fountaines,<note place="margin">Abſurd to tranſlate a tranſlation of Scriptures ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the fountaines.</note> yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the latine tranſlation hadde bene much perfecter and purer then it is: how

               <p>But your reaſons,<note place="margin">pag. 287.</note> whereby you labour to iuſtifie your doing in this behalfe, muſt be examined.<note place="margin">M.R. reaſons, why they might tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a tranſlation, anſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>Our Sauiour, the Euangiliſts, &amp; Apoſtles</hi> (you ſay) <hi>cited places of the old te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, not according to the Hebrew, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Septuagints.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Maſter Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi> your compariſon is not equall.

Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie it is one thing to tranſlate the ſcripture, and an other to cite a place of ſcripture. In citing a place, it is ſufficient to obſerue the true meaning, in tranſlating it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to keepe the wordes, as neare as maie be. Our ſauiour, his Euangeliſts and Apoſtles were no tranſlatours of ſcripture: but they truelie deliuered the ſenſe of

               <p>Your third example in <hi>Saint Iames</hi> ſheweth,<note place="margin">Iam. 4.6.</note> that the Apoſtle cited the words of the Greeke, &amp; not of the hebrew: which is graunted to be oftentimes in the new Teſtament vſed. But to alledge the ſenſe of a place, &amp; therin to follow ſome tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:27710:152"/>is another thing, then to tranſlate the text it ſelfe. The Hebrew text is to this ſenſe, <hi>He mocketh the mockers, and giueth grace to the meeke:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pron. 3.34.</note> 
                  <hi>Saint James</hi> rehearſeth the wordes thus, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giueth grace to the humble.</hi> The ſenſe is not altered, ſeeing theſe mockers are the proude men of this world, and God moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them, when he reſiſteth them.</p>
               <p>But tell me now, whether you think the Hebrew in theſe places to be corrupt, or no. I think you dare not ſo affirme, ſeeing your latine vulgar, which you account au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall, agreeth with the Hebrew, for the two laſt places. Then what is your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument out of theſe examples? gladly would I vnderſtand, if you could tell. That Chriſt and the Apoſtles cited places out of the olde teſtament according to the Greeke,<note place="margin">Haue an eie to M.R. concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it ſhal appeare he ſpeaketh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> was it becauſe the Hebrew was <hi>contaminated,</hi> as you ſpeake? If it were, then muſt you confeſſe your latine tranſlation, which you ſo much eſteeme to be full of corruption. Would you tranſlate theſe places according to the Greeke, becauſe you finde them cited by the Apoſtles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Greeke? Expound your dreame, <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> your, ſelfe, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:27710:152"/>tell vs what you ſaw. <hi>Caluine</hi> you charge for cutting the place of <hi>Iames</hi> cleane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie. Lay not the Printers fault vppon <hi>Caluine.</hi> If he had meant, as you ſurmiſe, he would haue cut the ſame ſentence out in <hi>Saint Peter</hi> alſo. But there you haue it ſet downe in the text, and expounded in the commentary.</p>
               <p>Your ſppoſes haue ſmall weight to ground an argument vpon:<note place="margin">pag. 290.</note> you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and imagine any thing what you liſte. Euery canonicall booke of the olde teſtament is extant in the ſame language wherin it was written. As for your bookes of <hi>Tobie, Iudith, Machabees,</hi> it is no matter in what tongue, or by whome they were ſet forth. That <hi>S. Matthewe</hi> writ his Goſpell in Hebrew, is affirmed, I graunt, by auncient fathers, but affirmed onelie, not prooued: and arguments there be manie to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. But admit that ſo it were: the Greeke was ſet forth in the Apoſtles daies, as the ſame authors confeſſe, and by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Church, as the true and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall hiſtory written by <hi>S. Matthewe,</hi> and of vs is ſo to be accounted. As for the Hebrew of that Goſpell now extant, your ſelfe beleeue not, I thinke, it is the ſame,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:27710:153"/>that, <hi>Saint Matthew</hi> writ, if he writ anie at all in Hebrue. Looke now to the force of this ſuppoſition a litle better your ſelfe, &amp; if you haue grace to conſider it aright, which you ſaie is wanting in me, you will confeſſe it prooueth nothing.</p>
               <p>My words by you tranſlated I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:<note place="margin">pag. 291. &amp;c.</note> out of which three things you note. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt that I confeſſe you refuſe not the foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taines, but becauſe you thinke them to be corrupt: which yet is not by me any where confeſſed. The fountaines indeed you refuſe, and of this refuſall the reaſon you pretend to be, that they are corrupt. Yet thinke I not, that ſo you are in trueth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, it being contrarie to all reaſon, that the tranſlation generallie ſhould be more pure and incorrupt, then the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it ſelfe, from whence it is deriued.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that I affirme you thus to ſay becauſe the fountaines be not ſo commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for you, as the tranſlation. This to be the true cauſe in deede any man may ſoone perceiue, that throughlie &amp; indifferentlie conſidereth your dealing: &amp; this in ſome examples I haue alreadie ſhewed, and can more at large declare, when occaſion ſhall require. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdlie that I tell you the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:27710:153"/>fountaines are more pure and holeſome, then the latine edition. Verilie this I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and this can I prooue, and this ſhal in the diſcourſe following appeare, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you haue alledged, or can alledge to the contrarie.</p>
               <p>In your entrie to the queſtion you thinke to gaine credit to your vulgare tranſlation by <hi>S. Ieromes</hi> authoritie,<note place="margin">pag. 294.</note> who was requeſted by <hi>Damaſus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to correct the latine tranſlation of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">Hier. in prefat, in nonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Teſt.</note> 
                  <hi>S. Ierome</hi> I reuerence, <hi>Damaſus</hi> I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, the worke I confeſſe to be godlie &amp; profitable to the Church. But if <hi>Ierome</hi> or <hi>Damaſus</hi> maie bring anie waight of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to your latine tranſlation, how much more ought we to haue in high and holie reuerence the Hebrewe and Greeke text, which was written, not by <hi>Ierome,</hi> or anie ſuch father of meane credite, but by the Prophets, by the Apoſtles and Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, not at the requeſt of <hi>Damaſus,</hi> or other like Biſhop, but by commaundement from God, and direction of the holie Ghoſt? <hi>S. Ierome</hi> tooke paines at <hi>Damaſus</hi> requeſt in the foure Euangeliſts: of his owne accord in manie bookes of the olde Teſtament: but this maketh nothing for your aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:27710:154"/>but much rather againſt it. For of this it plainlie appeareth at the firſt to euerie one, that in <hi>S. Ieromes</hi> daies, the vulgar tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations were greatlie corrupted, and that <hi>S. Ierome</hi> reformed the ſame by the Hebrew and Greeke text,<note place="margin">In S. Ieromes daies the Hebrewe and Greeke text acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged more ſincere then all tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> which argueth that the text was in thoſe daies generallie without contradiction acknowledged to be purer then all tranſlations whatſoeuer. Then if ſuch corruption crept into the Hebrewe and Greeke texte, as you affirme, it was after <hi>S. Ieromes</hi> daies: but when &amp; in what manner, you cannot tell. Againe that you ſaie this edition of <hi>S. Ierome</hi> was by <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> ſupreame authoritie commended to the Church, maie eaſilie be diſprooued: or if he laboured to haue it in the Latine Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches receiued, yet could he not bring it to paſſe.<note place="margin">Ieromes tran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſlation not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciallie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church for two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after Ierome. <hi>Greg. in. epiſt. ad Leand.</hi>
                  </note> For both other Churches vſed it not, and in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it was not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſingular eſtimation for the ſpace of two hundred yeares after <hi>S.

Gregorie,</hi> whoe writeth, that in his daies the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Church vſed two tranſlations, an old and a new. This newe is the ſame, which now is called the olde. The name of <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> if you thinke it maketh anie thing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:27710:154"/>for the Popes ſupreame authoritie, you are abuſed through your owne ignorance. It was a name belonging as well to euerie Biſhop, eſpeciallie of the chiefe Churches, as to <hi>Damaſus.</hi> But of ſuch ſpeaches you can be content to take aduantage to the abuſing of the ſimple.</p>
               <p>Foure thinges doe you propound to your ſelfe to prooue, concerning your vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tranſlation: Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that I haue ſaide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to purpoſe againſt it. Second, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that it is purer then the fountaines. Third, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that although it hath ſome ſmall faults, yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutelie it hath no errour touching either doctrine or manners. Laſt, that to refuſe it, and appeale to the Greeke and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe, is the highe waie to deniall of all faith, to Apoſtaſie and Atheiſme. Theſe thinges <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> hath thus deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not amiſſe: now let vs examine his proofes of theſe points for performance of his promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt you ſaie that in commending the fountaines ſo much,<note place="margin">pag. 297.</note> I have ſpoken nothing againſt you, but rather much and all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my ſelfe. If you can make your ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good herein, we ſhall haue cauſe much to commend your witt and learning. The
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:27710:155"/>reaſon that you haue brought, is by you vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in theſe words following. <hi>For if the fountaines were ſo pure in the times of S. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome and S. Ambroſe, and the Church then troubled with great diuerſitie of their Latine Bibles, reformed one to the puritie of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and originals, and we now finde thoſe fountaines and originals differing from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed bible, whie ſhall we not conclude, that the fountaines haue in the meane ſeaſon bene corrupted?</hi> And what cauſe haue you thus to conclude? where haue you learned to make ſuch concluſions? thinke you that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is ought worth? Let vs waie it a litle together, <hi>Maſter Rainolds,</hi> and then ſhall we better eſteeme the value of it. Firſt you graunt the fountains were pure in <hi>S. Ierome</hi> and <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> daies: the tranſlations cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. Doubtles it greeueth you to confeſſe thus much, but the neceſſitie of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame enforced you. Then foure hundred yeares after Chriſt by <hi>M. Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> confeſſion the fountaines of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe and Greeke texte were pure,<note place="margin">The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the Hebrew and Greeke text pure for the ſpace of four hundred yeares after Chriſt by the aduerſaries confeſſion.</note> and all tranſlations were reformed by them. Now let vs knowe ſome certentie of the great alteration that followed. What cauſe was there that the fountaines and originals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:27710:155"/>pure ſo long, and then after began to be ſo ſhamefullie and vniuerſallie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted? Againe, what was the cauſe that the latine tranſlations were ſo greatly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted for ſo long a ſpace, and neuer ſince could be corrupted? Tell vs ſome truth, ſhewe ſome reaſon, alledge your authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſpeake to purpoſe, and leaue theſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward preſumptions. The ſame meanes that kept the text pure all that while, whie might it not continew in times following? if you laie the fault of corrupting the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines vpon the Iewes, as you doe, were there no Iewes in the world, for the ſpace of foure hundred yeares after Chriſt, or were they either vnwilling or vnable to attempt ſuch a matter? it cannot be denied, but that within the compaſſe of thoſe yeares the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes had as great opportunities and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to haue performed ſo wicked an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, then ſince that time can be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Their malice againſt Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was no leſſe then, the number of their learned <hi>Rabbines</hi> was as great then, the troubles of the Church of Chriſt by reaſon of the great and general perſecutions, gaue better occaſion to them then: therefore if this corruption hath thus mightilie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:27710:156"/>in the text, may it pleaſe you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vs how and when it began: which requeſt ought not in anie wiſe ſeeme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable vnto you. For if you maie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of vs the time wherein corruption beganne to enter into the Church, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wil not beleeue vs that there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in the Church, may not we likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of you by as good reaſon, what time this foule corruption, wherof you ſpeake, firſt began to ſeaſe vpon the texte of ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? and if you cannot tell, how may you looke to be herein beleeued? The Iewes muſt be charged for all, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred which the Iewes beare to our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt be an argument that now all is corrupted in the Hebrew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saint Ierome</hi> ſaide he was aſhamed to ſee the Chriſtians thus vnworthily and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trulie charge the Hebrew veritie with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:27710:156"/>then in the Hebrew text, not onelie diſchargeth the Iewes from all ſuſpicion of corrupting their bookes, but giueth this rule, that whenſoeuer there is found any variety or difference in the texts, we ſhould geue greateſt credit to that tongue, out of which the interpreters haue made their tranſlation. Vpon which place Lewes Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues writeth thus,<note place="margin">Ludou, Viues ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>This ſame doth Ierome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch, and this reaſon it ſelfe teacheth: there is none of ſound iudgement that thinketh other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But in vaine doth the conſent of good witts thus thinke. For ſtout ſenſleſnes, as it were an hil, is oppoſed against it: not becauſe theſe men are ignorant of thoſe tongues, (for Auguſtine knew not the Hebrew &amp; the Greeke, but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie) but there is not in theſe men that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of minde, that was in Auguſtine. He was readie to be taught of all: they will neuer learne but alwaies teach that they know not.</hi> Thus hath <hi>Viues</hi> wtitten of you <hi>Maſter R.</hi> and ſuch abſurd and ſenſles fellowes as you, that againſt reaſon and truth will defend your tranſlations, although differing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much from the originall tongues, becauſe you are too ſtout, and want mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie.</p>
               <p>And for the Iewes thus much may be
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:27710:157"/>anſwered, that howſoeuer they miſlike and hate our religion, yet the text of holy ſcripture they haue euermore, and yet ſtill doe keepe moſt religiouſlie and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie. Which may appeare, for that there be,<note place="margin">Ioan. Iſaac. Contra Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan. lib. <hi>2.</hi> pa. <hi>77.</hi>

               <p>What madnes then ſhould driue them to corrupt the text, to no hindrance of our
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:27710:157"/>religion, to no furtherance of theirs? who doubteth, but if they had meant ſuch a thing, they would haue practiſed their skill in thoſe places eſpeciallie, that doe moſte directlie concerne the Goſpell of Chriſt, which being otherwiſe, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture of the Iewes dealing about the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew text is fooliſh, and falſe.</p>
               <p>You declame againſt the ignorance and reprobate minde of the Iewes: you ſet forth the promiſes made to the Church, of hauing alwaies the truth. And thinke you that this maketh anie thing for you? Do theſe promiſes of gods ſpirit and truth made to the Church belong onely to the latine Church? are they included onelie in the latine tranſlation? What ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come then in your iudgement of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Churches in <hi>Greece,</hi> in <hi>Armenie,</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabie,</hi> in all places of the world, that haue no skill of your latine Bibles?

               <p>You ſay, God hath promiſed the Church,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:27710:158"/>that <hi>ſhe ſhall be a faithfull and perpetuall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of his word and teſtament,</hi> that is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your new commentarie, that the Church ſhal loſe the pure fountains of the Hebrew text, but ſhal keepe a pure tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for euer. And ſee you not the vanity of this deuiſe? Confeſſed you not euen now, that in <hi>Damaſus</hi> daies all the latine tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were corrupt, wherupon <hi>S.

Then if the Bibles in latine were ſo much corrupted, before <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> by your own confeſſion, notwithſtanding the promiſe that God made the Church of keeping his word and teſtament, can you by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument prooue, that by force of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the latine Bibles haue not bene cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſince <hi>Saint Ieromes</hi> time, and the Hebrew haue?<note place="margin">Auguſt. epiſt. <hi>58.</hi> ad quaeſt. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith it came to paſſe by Gods ſpecial prouidence that the Iewes being ſo continuallie toſſed to and fro, and ſtill continuing their hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:27710:158"/>our ſauiour Chriſt, yet kept the holy ſcriptures, that the truth of Chriſts Goſpel might ſo much the more be approoued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all men, becauſe it receiued ſo ſure &amp; weightie teſtimonies of the moſt mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious enemies. And to this purpoſe he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth the verſe of the Pſalme, <hi>Lord kil them not, leſt they forget thy lawe, but ſcatter them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, al that you can ſay againſt the malice, falſhoode, and ignorance of the Iewes, nothing toucheth the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: for corruption whereof in the originall Greeke, I maruaile what you can deuiſe, ſeeing it was kept not in the cuſtody of Iewes, or paganes, but of moſte Godly and learned Chriſtians. Yet doe you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue it alſo, as well as the Hebrew, of the olde teſtament. what reaſon haue you <hi>M. Rainolds</hi> ſo to doe? was it alſo corrupted ſince <hi>S. Ieromes</hi> time, as you ſaid of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? The commentaries and writings of the Greeke fathers wil eaſily conuince you if ſo you ſay. For the text that we haue, is the ſame which they followed, expounded, and ſet downe in their writings, except there be in ſome fewe places ſome ſmall difference of reading. If the latine Church had any promiſe to keepe Gods truth and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:27710:159"/>teſtament in a latine tranſlation, will you denie that the Greeke Church had not the ſame promis to keepe it in the originall text? while you ſeeme to auouch the truth of gods promis toward the latine Church, as though you cared nothing how the Lord dealt with others, ſo he kept touch and couenant with yourſelues, you make him by your argument to be vnfaithful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Church of Greece, and all other Churches els in the world. Thus are you driuen into abſurdities and contradictions, as needes you muſt, when you maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine willfullie ſuch falſe aſſertions, as theſe.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Caluine</hi> affirmeth the Romane Church to haue bene more conſtant,<note place="margin">Pag. 300.</note> and leſſe giuen to nouelties then the Eaſt Chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches, whereby ſhe obtained greater fame and credit, then the reſt, nothing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this matter. For though it be graunted the Grecians were more factious for the moſt part and wauering, then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, yet might they retaine the original text of ſcripture, as faithfullie as they. No people ſo froward, ſo malitious, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, ſo contentious, ſo hard to be brought vnder the obedience of gods

And thoſe that are loſt of which you recken ſome, in ſome you are deceiued, they are wanting without anie loſſe or decaie of neceſſarie doctrine for the Church in thoſe times, wherein they were not extant. And that the Iewes haue bene more diligent to keepe their Bibles from corruption, then Chriſtians haue bene to keepe their tranſlations ſincere, who can doubt, conſidering that in <hi>S.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Two examples <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> willeth me to conſider:<note place="margin">pag. 332.</note> One, <hi>the greate diuerſitie of reading.</hi> That in the text is ſuch diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I deny. The Iewes may perhaps in their Commentaries be of diuerſe opinions, touching the reading, but in the text litle or no diuerſitie ſhall you finde: in ſo much that <hi>Ioannes Iſaac</hi> affirmeth,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2</hi> pag. <hi>69.</hi>
                  </note> there is ſoe great conſent and agreement in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that no booke of the bible can be ſhewed written with the hand of a Iewe, which either hath any thing that others want, or wanteth any thing that others haue. This may plainelie argue an excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding care to keepe their Bibles from all manner of corruption: althoughe this that he writeth may almoſte ſeeme incredible.</p>
               <p>An other experiment is, <hi>that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe printes want ſomething now, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainelie
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:27710:167"/>was in the firſt originals.</hi> Example hereof you bring the pſalme. 144. Which being made according to the Hebrew Alphabete, as diuerſe other are, one verſe is wanting wholly therein, the 14. in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which ſhould beginne with <hi>Nun.</hi> What cauſe there was of omitting this <hi>Acroſtiche</hi> I will not take vpon me to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. It is not of later times corrupted, ſeeing the Chaldee hath not that verſe. And as it is now in the Hebrewe, ſo was it in <hi>Saint Ieromes</hi> time, and before, when the Hebrewe Bibles were accounted moſt pure: and yet then in the Latine pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a verſe was ſupplied. So that howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the matter ſtande, this prooueth not the tranſlation to be of greater puritie and credit, then the fountaine. Cauſe there was doubtles, why the Prophet left out the order of the letter, but whether ſuch as the <hi>Rabbines</hi> and <hi>Talmud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſts</hi> haue deuiſed, I cannot affirme. The like example haue you in the. 36. Pſalme of your edition, which being made after the ſame manner of the Hebrew Alphabet, you haue not in it the letter <hi>Am.</hi> Reaſons thereof are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged both by Iewes, and learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; but the place for all that they thinke
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:27710:168"/>not to be corrupted, as you peraduenture will raſhlie pronounce. As for that in the Greeke and Latine of this Pſalme there is a verſe anſwerable, the firſt word whereof in Hebrew beginneth with <hi>Nun,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nasman.</note> 
                  <hi>Fidelis, Dominus, &amp;c.</hi> this prooueth not the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to be corrupte or vnperfecte: but the <hi>Septuagintes</hi> finding no verſe for the letter <hi>Nun,</hi> and thinking perhaps there was ſome want, repeated the. 17. verſe following, the firſt onely being changed. For this verſe ſupplied by them, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther following, is al one, excepting onely the firſt worde. It ſeemeth not that the Prophet was altogeather ſo curious to keepe the order of letters, that if any be wanting in a Pſalme of that kinde, we ought therefore to ſuſpecte corruption in the Hebrew. In the Pſalme. 25. no verſe beginneth with <hi>Vau:</hi> and two beginne with <hi>Reſh:</hi> and two with <hi>Pe.</hi> Wherefore you ſee how litle proofe of corruption this reaſon maketh, whatſoeuer you in your ignorance eſteeme of it.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> hetherto hath ſaide, as though it were greatly to purpoſe,<note place="margin">Pag. 333.</note> and worthie to be remembred, he gathereth now into certaine concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:27710:168"/>and as the ſmith, he beateth ſtil vpon the ſame anuill. I haue alreadie anſwered enoughe to the wholl: If any thing further be offered in this repetition, it ſhal be hand led. Firſt it is neither Iudaical, nor iniurious to the Church, to thinke more reuerentlie of the Hebrew fountaines, then the latine tranſlation, as hath beene ſhewed. Yea abſurde and vnlearned is it to preferre the tranſlation before the text, vpon certaine (I know not what) blinde ſurmiſes. Secondlie, if the hereſie of the <hi>Arrians</hi> corrupted the Latine Bibles, as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, whereupon they needed ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and reformation by <hi>Saint Ierome,</hi> how came it to paſſe, that the Greeke tranſlation of the ſeuentie, and the Greeke of the new teſtament, was not by that meanes much more corrupted, for ſo much as that hereſie preuailed much more in the Greeke then in the latine Churches? why notwithſtanding this hereſie, doe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers appeale to the Greeke fountaines of the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; by them amend their tranſlations? The <hi>Arrians</hi> would haue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the ſpring rather, then a ſtreame: and <hi>Saint Ierome</hi> had more cauſe in reſpect of them to ſuſpecte the Greeke, then the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:27710:169"/>latine. Whereby it is plaine that your geaſſe of the latine tranſlations, being troubled and corrupted by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> is vaine, and nothing but a geaſſe at all aduenture. That you ſay the Canon of the ſcripture in thoſe daies, was not by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall authoritie confirmed and receiued, though it be greate vntrueth, yet for as much as it pertaineth not directly to the matter, I will not ſtand vpon it.</p>
               <p>Two authorities <hi>M. R.</hi> alleadgeth out of the commentaries of <hi>S. Hierome</hi> vpon the epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians.</hi> The Apoſtle in the 3. Chap. citeth two teſtimonies out of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> not altogether accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to euerie word in the Hebrewe text. <hi>Saint Ierome</hi> among other reaſons hereof vſeth that for one, that the Iewes perhaps haue changed ſomething in their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. If the Apoſtle had alwaies bound him-ſelfe to the wordes, in rehearſing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities out of the olde teſtament, this reaſon had beene of waight: but ſeeing the Apoſtle <hi>Saint Paul</hi> and other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles vſe not preciſelie to recite the words of the text, but the ſence, <hi>Saint Ierome</hi> had no cauſe to ſuſpecte ſuch a matter in theſe places.

And was Chriſts naturall bodie hanging on the Croſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bread? was bread crucified for you? Els how maketh this for your reall preſence?

               <p>The laſt place in the 95. pſalme. v. 10. is no otherwiſe in the hebrew now, then not onelie in the Greeke, but in the vulgar latine, and <hi>Saint Ieromes</hi> tranſlation alſo,

               <p>The bookes of the holie Prophets all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are not ſo generallie and fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie defaced, as ſome other Scriptures, by this corrupt kinde of tranſlating, and by ſuch faultes as haue ſince the tranſlation growen by ſundrie meanes, yet are they not in your vulgar edition ſo incorrupt and ſincere, as they ought to be, ſeeing they maie by the authenticall text eaſilie be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. I might ſet downe ſundrie proofes and teſtimonies of ſuch imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as I haue now done in other books. And it were a thing greatlie to be wiſhed, that ſome man of learning and iudgement would throughlie and perfectlie diſcouer the corruptions of this wholl tranſlation: whereby it would fullie appeere what ſhame or trueth there is in the Church of Rome to prefer it before the faithfull origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bookes of holie ſcripture, as it doth now in parte appeere by this that hath
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:27710:194"/>bene before alledged. I verelie am afraid leſt I haue alreadie wearied the reader with multitude of examples: and the thing, which I tooke in hand to prooue, I haue not onelie in this treatiſe ſufficientlie, but alſo moſte plentifullie performed.</p>
               <p>The tranſlation of the new teſtament is ſomething more tolerable in reſpect, then of the old. Yet he that will looke narrowly into the ſame, ſhall finde cauſe and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough of complaint againſt either the ignorance, or negligence, or malice of ſome, by whoſe fault it hath bene noe better preſerued in that holie purenes and integritie, which the word of God doth require, and eſpeciallie this ſo ſingular a parte of his word. Wherein alreadie both <hi>Valla,</hi> and <hi>Faber,</hi> and <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Camerarius,</hi> and many mo haue labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſhew the errors of that tranſlation, for which their paines as they haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued great thankes of all the godlie, ſoe haue they receaued much hatred and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curteſie at the aduerſaries hands.</p>
               <p>For auoiding tedious length, more then were in this anſwere conuenient, I referr the readers for the new teſtament to thoſe learned writers, by peruſing of whome,

Which faultes they ſhal neuer be hable to approoue or iuſtifie, though they weary themſelues neuer ſo much with traueling and toyling, and ſeeking ſome defenſe.

R.</hi> beginneth to declame againſt.<note place="margin">pag. 361.</note> the newe Teſtament in Greeke, as he hath in the former Chapter done againſt the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Hebrew. Wherein how vnlearnedlie and vnworthelie he hath behaued him-ſelfe, the wiſe reader may perceiue by that which hath beene anſwered to his particular reprehenſions. And as no cauſe can be alledged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the latine tranſlation of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament before the Hebrew fountaine, ſo no leſſe abſurd and vnreaſonable is it to leaue the Greeke, and follow the vulgare tranſlation in the new teſtament.</p>
               <p>Their chiefeſt reaſon of greateſt ſhew and likelyhood againſt the Hebrew text is the malice and impietie of the Iewes, whoe being enimies of Chriſtian religion may therefore be thought to haue in many places corrupted their bibles of purpoſe to diſgrace and diſcredite the Goſpell of Chriſt. But as this is prooued moſte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, ſo being graunted for true, it can be no reaſon againſt the Greeke teſtament, which euer ſince the writing and firſt publiſhing thereof remained in the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:27710:196"/>and handling of moſt godlie fathers, Churches and Countries, who had as great skill and care to preſerue it from corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as had the latins to kepe their tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions pure and ſincere. Then what reaſon can you bring, or what colour of reaſon can you pretend in the new teſtament to cleaue onelie to the latine, and to reiecte the Greeke? The latine, you ſaie, is purer, then the Greeke. So haue your fellowes of <hi>Rhemes</hi> indeede tolde vs, and this they make their principall ground, whereupon they haue bene bolde to followe the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and not the Greeke, in tranſlating the new teſtament. But what aduantage ſoeuer you thinke to make of this, or any other ſuch reaſon, true it is, and by triall ſo ſhall be found, and hath heretofore by diuerſe ſufficientlie bene prooued, that the latine tranſlation of the new teſtament is more generallie &amp; notoriouſly corrupted, then you ſhall euer be hable to auouch of the Greeke originall text. That <hi>Beza</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſt <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in commendation &amp; defenſe of the latine tranſlation, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he meaneth not whollie to excuſe it from corruption in all places, but onelie in certaine, which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> found fault
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:27710:196"/>withall. For otherwiſe <hi>Beza</hi> ſheweth the vulgare tranſlation to be full of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if you reade his annotations, you may perceiue. Wherefore this teſtimony of <hi>Beza</hi> ſerued your <hi>Remiſts</hi> to litle purpoſe, but that they haue a ſleight to make ſuch things as are ſpoken, in ſome reſpecte, ſeeme to be vttered without exception, as in this place and many others may be ſeene.</p>

                  <hi>from the olde.</hi> It may perhaps (I graunt) be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that in the Greeke copies of the new teſtament ſome diuerſitie may be founde. So was there much greater difference in the latine tranſlations, as your ſelfe cannot deny. Then what maketh this for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tranſlation, againſt the Greeke foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine? if you ſay the latine was corrected, I anſwere, it was indede corrected, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Greeke, and the Greeke
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:27710:197"/>nowe remaineth ſtill, which maie be prooued to be not onelie as pure, as the latine, but purer by many degrees. For what reaſon haue you to ſaie, that the latine tranſlation euer ſince the correction hath bene preſerued faithfullie without corruption: but the Greeke text it ſelfe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which it was corrected, became forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with diſtayned and repleniſhed with groſſe corruptions? Our Greeke teſtament for the moſte parte, and in a manner eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where, agreeth fullie with that copie, which the auncient Greeke Church vſed, and which therefore vndoubtedlie was the true originall Greeke text of the newe teſtament. And as the olde latine Church reformed her tranſlations according to the copies vſed in the Greek Churches, ſo ſhall it neuer be prooued, but that the ſame Greeke copies haue continued ſtill as free from corruption, as the latine tranſlations haue: wherefore the difference of our Greeke copies nowe from ſome olde, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing againſt the puritie and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of our Greeke Teſtament, vnles you can ſhewe by euident proofe, that the Greeke Teſtament nowe extant differeth from that, which the Greeke Churches in
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:27710:197"/>times paſt generallie vſed. Some difference there might be (I denie not) in ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite multitude of copies. But what then? is no copie now therefore to be alowed? Maie we not alſo ſhewe the like diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene theſe latter editions of your latine tranſlation, and ſome other of elder time? you knowe we can, and it is by your owne writers confeſſed, &amp; acknowledged. Is this then a learned obſeruation? is this a good concluſion? is this a ſound reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the greek teſtament? ſuch arguments runne for currant at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> where popiſh blindnes raigneth: but being a litle ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and laid forth in the light, are by and by eſpied to be naught. Of this difference twoe examples you alledge: the former, is <hi>the ſtory of the adulterous woman</hi> in the eight of <hi>S. Iohn:</hi> which although ſome Greeke copies haue wanted, as apeereth by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riake interpreter, by <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> by <hi>Nonnus,</hi> by <hi>Ierome,</hi> yet others of as great authoritie had it. So this difference is not through la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter corruption, nor prooueth no more that the Greeke teſtament nowe is to be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, then it was in <hi>S. Chryſoſtomes</hi> daies. And furthermore this ſtorie being in your vulgare tranſlation, what can you deuiſe
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:27710:198"/>againſt the Greeke, more then the latine? The Greeke and latine agreeing, how is the Greeke more corrupt then the Latine? The other is in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Chap. 3. verſe 14. Wherein <hi>Saint Ierome</hi> ſaith certaine wordes were added in the latine, <hi>Domini noſtri Ieſu Chriſti,</hi> not being in the Greeke. But that herein <hi>Saint Ierome</hi> was deceiued, appeereth by <hi>S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> who readeth the wordes in the Greeke as you may ſee in his Greeke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries. And by this one example we may further note, what diligence <hi>Saint Ierome</hi> vſed ſome time in correcting the latine according to the Greeke, that deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wordes to be in the Greeke, which yet are found in <hi>Saint Chryſoſtomes</hi> copies, and manie moe.</p>

The controueſie is not, which tranſlation is beſt, and moſte to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but whether this latine edition of your tranſlator, whoſoeuer he were, be worthely of your Church preferred before the originall fountaine.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:27710:199"/>in faithfull tranſlators of ſcripture, &amp; in reſpect thereof deſerueth greater cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditte, then the reſt: doth it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, <hi>Maſter Rainolds,</hi> that we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre him before the writers of holie ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture themſelues? was he of ſounder reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion towards God, indued with greater grace and ſpirit, more voide of partialitie and affection, then they? Otherwiſe if you compare him with other tranſlators, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I knowe herein your iudgement is altogether partiall, yet as this reaſon may aduance him to higher eſtimation then other tranſlators: ſo muſt it caſt him down as much and more beneath the writers them ſelues, in that they being choſen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of God for that purpoſe, were moſte plentifullie indued and aſſiſted with al graces of the holie Ghoſt, which can not be auouched of that tranſlator, how excellent otherwiſe ſoeuer he were. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſurmiſes and geaſſes of corruptions in the originall texte more then in the tranſlation, as they are by you oft repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; by ſundry impertinent teſtimonies of our writers idlelie enlarged, ſo ſhal they neuer be trulie and ſubſtantiallie prooued, whereby it might appeere that the latine
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:27710:200"/>tranſlation is more to be alowed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed generallie then the Greeke text.</p>
               <p>To oppoſe ſome of our new tranſlators againſt your olde,<note place="margin">pag. 375. &amp;c.</note> were verelie an eaſie matter: but thus ſhould we ſlippe awaie from the queſtion, and fall to other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, wherin the controuerſie lieth not. If we ſhould attribute as much learning and diligence to your tranſlator, as ſuch a man could haue and vſe, yet would you confeſſe (I truſt) he were ſtill far inferior to the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Euangeliſts, whoſe writings remaine, and are the holy canonicall ſcriptures of God. Theſe writinges do we oppoſe againſt your tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, and theſe doe you wickedlie and ſhamfullie diſhonour, in preferring the tranſlation of ſuch a man before them. This you are not hable either reaſonably to defend, or colourablie to excuſe, and therefore you runne another waie, as though you chaſed your enemie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as feare cauſeth your felfe to flie. All this talke of <hi>Eraſmus, Luther, Zuinglius, Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius, Caſtalion, Caluine, Beza,</hi> and their tranſlations, is from the purpoſe. We make no ſuch account of anie of them, as you doe of yours, to allowe and receiue
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:27710:200"/>whatſoeuer they haue tranſlated, without examining their tranſlations by the text. we prefer whome we know to haue dealt in that worke moſte faithfullie, and if we find by skill and triall ſome ouerſight in the tranſlation (as in the beſt ſome may be found) we cleaue to the originall text of ſcripture, and not after your prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner, to the corrupt tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now of all tranſlations ſet forth by Proteſtants of all countries, ſure I am you cannot ſhewe any ſo repugnant to the veritie of the Hebrewe and Greeke fountaines, as I can ſhew, and as it hath bene ſhewed that yours is. That <hi>Luthers</hi> and <hi>Bezaes,</hi> and the other ſeuerall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations haue bene by ſome in certaine places reprooued, is true. But what kinde of argument call you this, becauſe ſome errours haue bene noted in this or that tranſlation, therefore to conclude the wholl tranſlation is nought, or worſe then yours? <hi>Emſerus</hi> a papiſt (you ſay) hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of <hi>Luthers</hi> tranſlation <hi>fourteene hundred foule lies.</hi> If I ſaide, that this in him were a foule lie, I ſhould ſay truelie: <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> tranſlation hath bene ſufficientlie commended and maintained by men of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:27710:201"/>greater wiſdome and learning then <hi>Emſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> That <hi>Zuinglius</hi> alſo miſliked <hi>Luthers</hi> tranſlation in ſome parts, and <hi>Beza</hi> the <hi>Baſill</hi> tranſlation, and that of <hi>Caſtalion,</hi> and <hi>Molinaeus Calaines,</hi> and <hi>Bezaes</hi> tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which matters are by you at large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, as thouge they made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to purpoſe, I graunte and giue you leaue to make thereof what you can. But if this ſeeme in your iudgement a thing ſo odious and ſlanderous to our tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that thus they haue bene ſeuerallie charged by ſome, what may we thinke and ſaie of you, that not content to accuſe our tranſlations (though far better then anie you haue) of ſuch impietie, dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the originall bookes them ſelues now extant to be ſo full of groſſe and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious corruptions (which you ſhall neuer prooue) that your vulgar tranſlation knowne to be moſte corrupt, is purer then they? what ſoeuer hath bene ſaied by any againſt our tranſlations, is in no reſpect of like hainouſnes to this, ſeeing that not onlie the bookes of ſcripture were written and ſet foorth at the firſt moſte purelie, but the meanes alſo haue euermore bene as great to keepe and continue them in the

               <p>Your iudgement of our Engliſh Bibles is anſwerable to that ſpirit, where with you are poffeſſed, and of the abundance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you write. <hi>Nothing els they are</hi> (you ſaie) <hi>but corrupt gutters flowing from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte and ſtinking lakes,<note place="margin">M.

No tranſlation of the ſcripture can at the firſt be ſo perfecte and ſincere, but it may be afterwardes amended, as God ſhall reuele to his Church the faultes thereof. Otherwiſe if it were any fault to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a fault, why hath your Councell of

But your ſeconde reaſon is more abſurde, wherein you profeſſe that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you had the true originals, yet could you not make in theſe daies a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tranſlation. Wherefore could you not? the thinge is not harde if you had ſimple and willing mindes. But now may we ſee by this your proteſtation, that whatſoeuer you ſpeake againſt the corruption of the originall bookes, in reſpecte where of you will ſeeme to preferre your common tranſlation before them, yet although you had as true originals as euer were or could be wiſhed, notwitſtanding you woulde ſtill make more account of your tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then of them.</p>
               <p>That wherefoeuer we find faulte with your tranſlation, ſome one of our owne brethren ſtandeth with you in defenſe of your tranſlation, is vntrue. I haue ſhewed examples enowe of groſſe and manifeſt corruptions in the tranſlation of the olde

Secondlie you adde, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that ſome reaſon you haue to thinke that percel repeated not to be of the text. As good haue you to thinke that theſe wordes <hi>when this mortall ſhall put on immortalitie,</hi> are not of the text, ſeing they are ſett downe in the lines immediatlie going before. Thirdlie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that it was in ſome greeke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, as you reade.

Fiftlie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> you thinke it enough for defenſe of your tranſlation, that the ſame wordes are added in the margent, which is but a poore ſhift, when you haue thruſt the text of ſcripture out of his due and proper ſeate, to giue it ſome roome in a corner. And yet your Engliſh tranſlation hath diſcharged it of that place alſo, and wipte it cleane awaie both out of text and margent.</p>
               <p>That not here onelie,<note place="margin">pag. 399. &amp;c.</note> but in other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde places alſo you keepe the errors of the latine tranſlation contrarie to the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Greeke copies, is a thing that hath bene plentifullie prooued by manie, and therefore to ſaie ſo, was no bragge. <hi>Aria Montanus</hi> how good a prieſt ſoeuer he be, doubtles is not of your iudgement concerning the Hebrewe and greeke ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals of ſcripture, and therefore cannot alowe that wicked decree of the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Councell, wherein the corrupt tranſlation is confirmed and eſtabliſhed for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical

The blaſphemie of which aſſertion,<note place="margin">M. Rain. ſaith that in the Hebrew text of ſcripture there is no holde.</note> I dout not euerie reaſonable man at the firſt will eſpie and abhorre. For ſeeing it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord, of all tongues of men vnder heauen to chuſe that tongue, wherein to write his word &amp; oracles, that his Church might haue a moſt perfecte and certaine rule of religion, ſhall this Papiſt come and controll the wiſdome of God for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſay that of the Hebrew litle holde can be taken to binde a contentious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike? Thus it appeereth, that although we
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:27710:211"/>had the verie ſame <hi>Autographall</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall</hi> copies, which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the other Prophets did write with their owne handes, yet would this Seminary papiſt and his fellowes make leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them then of their tranſlation, as being leſſe hable to binde heretikes then it.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt <hi>the diuerſe ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of euerie worde almoſte,</hi> which may ſeeme perhapes to ſome ſimple bodie to make for their tranſlation againſt the Hebrew. Whereunto I anſwere, firſt that although the Hebrew were ſo vncertaine in reſpect of the manifold and diuerſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of wordes, as they would haue it, yet were there noe cauſe whie the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tranſlation ſhould more be allowed for the vndoubted word of God, then the Greek or any other in the world. They are all noe better then tranſlations; and what warrrant is there for one more then an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but onelie in commendation of greater ſinceritie, and that in reſpecte of faithfully expreſſing the Hebrew? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie this variety of ſignifications is not late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie begonne, but was alwaies from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: which notwithſtanding the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:27710:212"/>could ſpeake, and write their mindes as plainlie and certainlie, as anie other people: and the ſcriptures were read and expounded in that language manie hundred yeares before anie parte of them was tranſlated into Latine. So that this reaſon maketh them now no leſſe hable to binde heretikes, then they haue euermore bene from the beginning. And what tongue (I praie you) were the ſcriptures written in, which the Apoſtle exhorteth <hi>Timothie</hi> to read, that he might ſtoppe the mouthes of heretikes, and which he ſaith are profitable to conuince the Aduerſaries, but in the Hebrewe and Greeke? your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tranſlator was then vnborne, when yet the ſcriptures in their original tongues were able to binde and confute all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes. Your example out of the Pſalme 55. ver. 21. ſheweth a plaine corruption in your tranſlation. For that Hebrew worde with theſe letters and prickes cannot ſignifie <hi>to reward,</hi> as your tranſlation hath, but <hi>vpon thoſe that haue peace with him,</hi> as our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the moſte haue according to the Hebrewe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is,<note place="margin">pag. 433.</note> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that <hi>manie ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues maie haue diuerſe deriuations from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:27710:212"/>verbes:</hi> and one example is brought out of the 60. Pſalme, v. 6. To this maie be anſwered as to the former, that if this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of deriuation cauſe a diuerſitie of expoſitions, it maketh no more againſt the Hebrew text now, then euer ſince the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew was firſt written.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie,<note place="margin">pag. 434.</note> touching the literal ſenſe of the hebrew words, you demaund what ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſters we ſhall followe. If a controuerſie be about the ſignification of a word, whome ſhould we followe rather then the moſte learned maſters of that tongue? they can beſt reſolue vs that know the tongue beſt: and as this for wordes in all other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is the onelie waie, ſo likewiſe if we doubt of ſome worde in hebrewe, what meanes maie we vſe to be inſtructed and ſatisfied, but to learne of thoſe that are moſte skilful in the tongue, and beſt know the naturall force of the words. Who can denie that this is much better, then as your tranſlator oftentimes doth, to call blacke white, and to giue a ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a worde, which all Hebricians can tell, is cleane amiſſe. Examples hereof are in your tranſlation plentifull, as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you knew not, now by that which I
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:27710:213"/>haue alreadie alledged, you maie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. That which followeth of <hi>Caluine, Beza,</hi> and the reſt, hath nothing, but a poore bragge not worth the mentioning.</p>
               <p>To your queſtion,<note place="margin">pag. 437.</note> whether I thinke it flat Atheiſme and Turkery, to denie that Chriſt was borne of a virgine, I anſwere, no Chriſtian can thinke otherwiſe but that it is indeed plaine Atheiſme, to denie this ſo principall an article of our faith. Then you require what ſcripture I haue to prooue this veritie. I anſwere, I prooue this veritie by a plaine text of ſcripture, in Matt. 1. v. 23.<note place="margin">

But what cauſe or reaſon haue you thus to ſaie? Becauſe this texte is not according to the Hebrewe, but the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:27710:213"/>ſeauentie as you affirme. Which to be a foule vntrueth and tending to Atheiſme and Turciſme, whoe ſeeth not? For if the Angels wordes rehearſed in <hi>Saint Matthew</hi> be not agreeable to the veritie of the Prophets wordes, then may Turkes, Iewes, Atheiſts, and wicked heretikes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dede at their pleaſure not onelie diſpute againſt this article of our faith, but alſo condemne it, and we ſhall not be hable to conuince them. This aduantage giueth <hi>M.

I graunt you haue
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:27710:214"/>not diſgraced the tongues, but the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures written in thoſe tongues you haue indeauoured as much as in you laie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, although doe what you can, you ſhall neuer be able to diſgrace them truly. And herein may you firlie be compared to the Iewes; for as they keepe the Hebrew text moſte carefullie, but yet haue loſt the true meaning thereof: ſoe you haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed printed the old and new teſtament in Hebrew and Greeke with diligence and great coſt, but in the meane time you deny them to be the authenticall word of God.</p>
               <p>This treatiſe you conclude ful diſcreetly, that firſt we muſt be ſure of our faith. That is a verie good thing, but how this ſhould be wrought, you tell vs not. The latine tranſlation is for this purpoſe no fitter, then the Hebrew and Greeke fountaines, but rather manie waies more vnfitte, being onelie a tranſlation, and that an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecte, a corrupt, an obſcure tranſlation: &amp; though it were as excellent as euer any tranſlation could be, which God knoweth is far otherwiſe, yet might it not attaine to the diuine perfection of the originall text that was written, and publiſhed by the wiſdome of Gods holie ſpirit, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:27710:215"/>of the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſtes. But (ſaie you) let vs holde the Church, then our Greeke and Hebrew may do vs ſome good: let vs departe from her, our Greeke and Hebrew will turne to our perdition. And I graunt <hi>M.

But this is true no leſſe, I am ſure, of your latine, then of the Greeke and Hebrew, vnles there be ſome ſecrete vertue in that, which is not in the other, that to talke of it, though a man hold not either faith or Church, may be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable thing.

If anie man els can ſo vnderſtand it, I am content to let it be ſo taken. To me it ſeemeth ſtraunge, that anie man of reaſon ſhould thinke and write thus abſurdlie, thus pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhlie, thus falſely, vnles it were to make him ſelfe ridiculous, and odious to all the worlde. But of this ſo fooliſh a conceit of his, we neede not to ſpeake moe words.

Here is no place to make diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this queſtion, whether God be author of ſinne: which as it is a moſt impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſſertion, ſo haue you moſte falſelie obiected it vnto vs ſundrie times, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer could prooue it once.

Therefore to tranſlate the one for the other, as it is altogether vnproper, ſo is it moſte daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in the ſcriptures, becauſe thereof may followe errors in iudgement, and practiſe of life.

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:27710:222"/>certaine blaſpemies againſt the holie Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>
               <p>In the firſt order were reckened certaine traditions,<note place="margin">pag. 484. &amp;c.</note> which hauing no ground in Gods word, nor much differing from mere fables, are in your <hi>Rhemiſh Annotations</hi> notwithſtanding gloriouſlie auouched, as behouefull for all Chriſtians to beleeue. And firſt of the wiſemen that came from the Eaſt to viſite our ſauiour Chriſt, three things are affirmed, firſt that they were kings, ſecondlie that they were three,<note place="margin">Popiſh tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions full of fables and va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nities</note> and laſtlie that their names were <hi>Gaſpar, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior,</hi> and <hi>Baltaſar,</hi> as now commonlie they are called. For the firſt, <hi>Maſter R.</hi> demaundeth a reaſon, why I ſhould thinke they were no kinges, himſelfe not hable to ſhew any, why he ſhould ſaie they were kings. But if reaſon may rule him, for which he calleth, as though he would yeelde vnto it, if it were giuen him, three reaſons will I propounde, wherebie I am mooued not to beleeue that theſe men were kings.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the Euangeliſt calleth them by noe ſuch names,<note place="margin">The wiſe me, that came to worſhippe Chriſt, ſaid to be kinges againſt reaſon.</note> which yet he would not haue omitted, if the truth had bene according to your tradition, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:27710:223"/>how this would haue made for the honour of Chriſt, that ſo ſoone as he was borne, kings ſhould haue ſought him far, and done vnto him homage and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And when you maintaine your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by this argument, for that it is hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the perſon of our ſauiour Chriſt that ſo we ſhould thinke of them, you charge therein the holy Euangeliſt for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſomewhat, that might haue great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie aduanced the honor of Chriſt, if he had truelie and fullie reported the ſame. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, it is not credible, that <hi>Herods</hi> would haue admitted into his kingdome and chiefe Citie three Kings with their troupes, eſpeciallie there being enemity betwixt him and the kinges of <hi>Perſia:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they haue ſo ſecretlie come to our ſauiour Chriſt, and eſcaped out of the countrie againe, but that being kings, and therefore no dout accompanied in ſome princelie ſorte, they muſte needs haue bene diſcried. Thirdlie if they had bene, as you imagine, kings, yea and Monarches, as great as the king of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spayne,</hi> or the great <hi>Sophie</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> which you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe might be, then would they not haue left our ſauiour Chriſt and his Mother in
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:27710:223"/>that poore eſtate, that ſhe was able to offer no more, but a paire of doues, according to the oblation of the pooreſt amongſt the people. If you can remooue the ground of theſe reaſons, I will confeſſe your opinion hath in it more probability then I thought, although to beleeue it, as you do, for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truth, I cannot, becauſe thereof I know no ſure reaſon can be alleadged. The fathers I graunt ſome of them ſpeake of theſe wiſe men as of kings, taking that word in a larger ſenſe, for great and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſonages, ſuch as may be thought that they were: but the ground of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is a place of ſcripture miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, in the 72. Pſalme, concerning the kings of <hi>Tharſis, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Sheba,</hi> that ſhould bring giftes, which cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to theſe, for ſo much as thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are not Eaſtward from <hi>Iudea,</hi> and the ſcripture plainly ſaith, that theſe wiſe men came out of the Eaſt. Therefore whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any father hath written to this purpoſe, is lightlie to be regarded, hauing no better ground then a manifeſt wreſting of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and turning South into Eaſt.</p>
               <p>Now that they were alſo three,<note place="margin">pag. 489.</note> how may it be prooued? forſooth here is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:27710:224"/>of the bleſſed Trinitie, whereunto <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> moſt ſweetl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e alludeth. At this moſt heauenlie myſterie, <hi>Maſter Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi> none will be grieued, ſaue onelie moſt wicked and deteſtable heretikes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. But how appeareth it, that theſe wiſe men did repreſent and ſignifie that myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> ſaie ſo: and therefore we muſt beleeue it is ſo. Which argument I will admit if becauſe their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were of three thinges, therefore it follow neceſſarilie, that them-ſelues, whoe offered, were three. Yet <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> hath a better reaſon then this, if it will be accepted. The Euangeliſt (ſaith he) ſpeaketh of them in the duall number, and therefore they were moe then two: but we neede not to beleeue that they were moe then three. Neither need we to beleeue that they were iuſte three: for the Euangeliſt ſpeaking of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitlie, as he doth, we may as well thinke they were moe then three, as well as three, and ſo alſo indeede ſome fathers haue thought. So that this hangeth vpon a ſlender threede of mans conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which cannot be warranted by myſticall expoſitions. And if herein were
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:27710:224"/>conteined ſo ſweete and excellent my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, much maie we maruell, why the Euangeliſtes would not plainelie write, for better vnderſtanding of this myſterie, that they were neither fewer, nor moe, then iuſt three.</p>
               <p>Laſtlie, touching their names,<note place="margin">pag 490.</note> 
                  <hi>Maſter R.</hi> asketh, ſeeing they were not name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, why their names were not <hi>Gaſpar, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior, Baltaſar,</hi> rather then <hi>William, Iohn, and Thomas.</hi> I graunt as well maie we thinke the one as the other: but reaſon is there none to thinke either. That their names might haue bene continued in the Church, I denie not as well as thoſe force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers names were, of whome <hi>S. Paule</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention. And ſo ſtandeth your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Their names might be ſuch, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ſuch: they might be three, therefore they were three: they might be Kings, therefore they were Kings. And thus in Popiſh traditions the argument holdeth well <hi>a poſſe ad eſſe,</hi> contrarie to the rules of all Logique in the world. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of theſe three counterfaite Kinges, of Colen.</p>
               <p>That Iohn the Baptiſt was an Eremite,<note place="margin">pag. 482.</note> and patrone of Eremiticall life, is as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:27710:225"/>as the other. Firſt, ſcripture haue you none for this Tradition of yours: for then it were not a right tradition, if you could bring ſomething out of ſcripture for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation thereof. The Euangeliſts ſaie not, that he liued alone from companie of men in the wildernes, as your Eremites did, but that he liued in that countrie of <hi>Iudea,</hi> which in reſpect of other parts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more populous,<note place="margin">Hier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Yet that ſuch a thing might be, he prooueth by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Aharons</hi> rod and the <hi>Manna,</hi> which were by Gods ſpeciall commaundement preſerued in the Arke. But was there anie like commandement, or cauſe to keepe the ſtone, that rebounded from <hi>Saint

               <p>For <hi>Elias</hi> comming before the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are alledged ſundrie Doctors.<note place="margin">pag. 494</note> So then belike all is ſafe on their ſide, if they can approoue their opinions and expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by Teſtimonies of ſome Doctors. But this will not ſerue, vnles the Doctors ſaying be warranted by Gods worde, as we haue a thouſande times tolde them. Now this imagination of <hi>Elias</hi> comming is by the wordes of our ſauiour Chriſt plainlie confuted, whoe teacheth that <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 17.13.</note> according to the prophecie of <hi>Mela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi> was come alreadie: and the Apoſtles vnderſtood that he meant of <hi>Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> whoe was <hi>Elias,</hi> not in perſon, but in ſpirite and power. Then the prophecie of <hi>Elias</hi> comming being fulfilled in <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> as our ſauiour himſelfe hath taught, vaine is it to dreame of an other comming then that, wherof no worde can be found in all the ſcriptures of God. Wherefore as you compare the fathers with vs, to make your cauſe ſeeme the more probable, ſo will I compare the ſcriptures with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe authoritie is much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparablie aboue theirs, then theirs is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

Chriſt and <hi>Peter</hi> walked on the waters,<note place="margin">Matt. 14.26.</note> therefore it is euident, that Chriſts bodie may be in compaſſe of a litle bread. This to be a moſt falſe argument, not onelie in true Diuinitie, but alſo in naturall reaſon, is manifeſt. For had Chriſt or <hi>Peter</hi> a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that both walked on the water, and walked not on the water at one time? Doe the ſcriptures ſo teach, or is there no ſuch thing to be found in them? If not, then is not this like to you imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned preſence of Chriſts bodie in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: which being graunted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your doctrine of tranſſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inferreth moſte neceſſarilie, that Chriſts bodie at once is both compaſſed
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:27710:226"/>in a litle bread, which is contrarie to the nature of a mans true bodie: and alſo is not compaſſed therein, as ſitting in heauen, and hauing the naturall properties of a true bodie, which cannot be brought within ſo narrowe a compaſſe as is your wafer cake. This is repugnant to ſcripture, to reaſon, to Gods ordinaunce, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a moſte abſurde and impoſſible thing is it, that Chriſts bodie ſhould remaine a true naturall bodie, and yet at once be contained in ſo ſmall a compaſſe, as you teach. In that Chriſt and <hi>Peter</hi> walked on the water, no ſuch inconuenience nor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie can be found, whether the waters were made by miracle firme as the ground, or the bodies were ſuſtained by Gods power, that they ſuncke not. Chriſt might beare vp him-ſelfe and <hi>Peter</hi> from ſinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe, by his diuine power, and chaunge no naturall propertie of his or <hi>Peters</hi> bodie: but Chriſts bodie can not be brought into that ſlender compaſſe of your mathematicall cake, without deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all properties incident vnto a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body. So then betweene theſe two is no likenes at all, as any man not blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Popiſh folly, and not wilfullie
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:27710:227"/>ſhutting his eyes againſt the cleare light may manifeſtlie perceiue. Wherefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting this argument, you proteſt that your note conſiſteth not ſo much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, as in the authoritie of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> whoe hath not anie worde at all to this purpoſe. For tell vs, <hi>Maſter Rainolds,</hi> doth <hi>Epiphanius</hi> drawe an argumente from Chriſts walking on the water, to prooue his bodie reallie preſent in the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bread? No ſuch matter can you finde in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> or any auncient father of Chriſts Church. That which Chriſt hath ſaid, he that beleeueth not to be true, is fallen from grace and ſaluation, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writeth: but Chriſt hath neuer ſaid, that his bodie ſhould be in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of a litle bread. Howbeit what talke you of a <hi>litle bread?</hi> when you teach no bread at all remaineth, but onelie ſignes and ſhadowes of bread.

                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 7.17.</note> Whereof what other thing can poſſiblie be collected, but that the Apoſtle hath not by ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons prooued that thing which he tooke in hand to prooue, that Ieſus Chriſt is a prieſt for euer after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech?</hi> For theſe men boldelie affirme that all this prooueth not that in proper ſignification Chriſts prieſthood is perpetuall: then the Apoſtle in proper ſignification hath proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nothing leſſe, then that which he went about to prooue, concerning Chriſtes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting prieſthood, wherein all our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation conſiſteth, &amp; hath but vſed a ſleight to make men beleeue a thing, which either he coulde not prooue, or at leſt hath not effectuallie prooued. Our papiſts wil haue

Nowe hereof the Apoſtle hath not ſpoken ſo much as one word, nor giuen the leaſt ſignification of ſuch a matter. What other thing is it then but plaine blaſphemie for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of an idolatrous ſacrifice to charge the Apoſtle that he hath not prooued Chriſts prieſthood to be perpetual, which yet he hath by moſte neceſſarie and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall arguments prooued? For as the Apoſtle reaſoneth, if Chriſtes perſon be perpetuall, as it is; and if he make for vs perpetuall interceſſion, as he doth; and if by his one ſacrifice offered once he hath wrought a full and perfect redemption, as he hath; then is it hereof in proper ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation prooued, that Chriſts prieſthood alſo is perpetuall, and then haue theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapert papiſts blaſphemed in denying the Apoſtles arguments to be good in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignification, which is in effect to take from them all credit and authoritie. Let <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> deuiſe what cunning ſhift he can, yet in truth neuer ſhall he be
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:27710:236"/>hable to wipe out this blot of blaſphemie: when the Apoſtle hath of purpoſe labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to prooue Chriſts eternall prieſthood, and prooued it indeede moſt inuinciblie, for theſe Collegiates of <hi>Rhemes</hi> to come in with their cenſure vpon the Apoſtle, and to ſet downe in plaine termes that all this prooueth not the matter in proper ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and that the Apoſtle hath omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the chiefe and proper proofe thereof. This is a blaſphemie againſt Chriſt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy ſpirit of God, by which the Apoſtle in writing was directed.</p>
               <p>But what can <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> ſaie in excuſe of this ſo manifeſt blaſphemie?<note place="margin">pag. 534.</note> He asketh firſt, <hi>Where ſaie we that of all thoſe things propoſed by the Apoſtle, it followeth not that Chriſts prieſthood is eternall?</hi> Muſt you againe be put in minde of your owne Annotation, which your ſelfe haue at large rehearſed? Haue you not therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſlie in writing publiſhed, <hi>All this proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not that in proper ſignification his prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is perpetuall?</hi> And what differeth this from that, which I haue affirmed of you? Hath the Apoſtle propounded any thing concerning your pretended ſacrifice. If he hath, ſhew vs where, in what words,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:27710:236"/>after what ſort. If any thing at all can be ſhewed to this purpoſe, as nothing indeed can, and without this be ſhewed, in your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion the eternitie of Chriſts prieſthood is no wais ſufficientlie prooued, doe you not plainlie declare your iudgement to be that it followeth not of al thoſe thinges, which the Apoſtle hath ſaid that Chriſtes prieſthood is eternall? yea but <hi>M.R.</hi> ſaith, that they haue auouched the cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in ſaying, <hi>that all the fathers gather of this deepe and diuine diſcourſe, the eternitie of his Prieſthood.</hi> The fathers indeed haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of this diſcourſe moſt truelie the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie of Chriſts Prieſthood, and therein they confute your wicked dannotation, that ſaith, <hi>all this prooueth not Chriſtes Prieſthood to be perpetuall.</hi> They vnderſtood the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle rightlie, and they expounded his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faithfully. Shew me now one ancient father if you can <hi>M. R.</hi> that euer ſaide as you ſaie, that all this alledged by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle prooueth not in proper ſignification, that Chriſtes prieſthoode, is perpetuall: or els that he taught, as you teach, that Chriſt muſt continuallie be ſacrificed in forme of bread and wine. This is the point, this ſhew vs, if you can. For in your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:27710:237"/>no ſuch thing is ſhewed, and all the fathers confeſſe with one conſent, that the Apoſtle hath prooued ſoundly the eternitie of Chriſts Prieſthood, and that no other ſacrifice remaineth to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, but onelie a remembrance and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of that one euerlaſting ſacrifice to be continued in the Church to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondlie it is confeſſed by <hi>Maſter Rainolds</hi> that the Apoſtle maketh not anie expreſſe mention of that oblation of bread and wine.<note place="margin">pag. 536.</note> But what reaſon was there, why the Apoſtle entreating of Chriſtes eternall preiſthood, omitted the principall part thereof? Conſider good reader, into what miſerable ſtraites theſe men are driuen, and what abſurde deuiſes they are enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to forge. For their beſt excuſe is that becauſe the Iewes <hi>beleeued not the firſt, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and ſoueraigne ſacrifice of the croſſe, therefore he would not vrge them with this ſecondarie and dependente ſacrifice of the Church.</hi> Which in trueth is nothing els, but a ſeelie ſhift to ſalue a deſperate ſore. For firſt it is euident the Apoſtle writ to thoſe that were not ignorant of Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing they had learned alreadie the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:27710:237"/>principles thereof, and are exhorted by the Apoſtle to proceed to perfection ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.<note place="margin">Hebr. 6.1.</note> Secondlie whereas the Apoſtle hath diſcourſed ſo plentifullie of the principal and ſoueraigne ſacrifice, what reaſon was there to keepe ſilence of the ſecondarie ſacrifice, as you call it? Might they heare of the greater, and not of the leſſe? Might the Apoſtle vrge ſo earneſtlie vnto them the ſacrifice of the croſſe, and might he not in a word mention the ſacrifice of the Altar? Coulde the one be more offenſiue vnto them then the other? Let all men iudge what trueth there is in this deuiſe.</p>
               <p>Of that which followeth concerning this matter, nothing deſerueth anſwere,<note place="margin">pag. 540.</note> ſaue onelie that <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> asketh of me, whether <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> did not ſacrifice? I ſaie, no doubt <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> did ſacrifice: for otherwiſe he had not bene a prieſt. <hi>But Saint Paul</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>maketh no expreſſe mention thereof.</hi> What then, I praie you? Forſooth <hi>by Maſter Whittakers iudgement Saint Paul omitteth ſome principall part of Melchiſedechs prieſthood.</hi> Whoe euer heard a more fooliſh collection? it was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Apoſtle that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was a prieſt, which is confirmed by plaine
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:27710:238"/>teſtimonie of ſcripture: to rehearſe anie ſpeciall kinde of ſacrifice by him offered was nothing neceſſarie to the purpoſe in hand. And therefore the Apoſtle hath not omitted any principall part of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dechs</hi> prieſthood, vnles you will ſay it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prooued neceſſarilie, that one hath bene a prieſt, except euerie particular ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that euer was offered by him, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded and auouched. This being moſte abſurd, ſee how vaine a conceite of yours this was, that the Apoſtle hath omitted ſome principall parte of <hi>Melchiſedechs</hi> prieſthood, becauſe he hath not declared expreſſelie what ſpeciall ſacrifice <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> offered.</p>
               <p>An other example I noted out of the ſixt Chapter to the Romanes,<note place="margin">pag. 543. &amp;c.</note> in that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table place, where the Apoſtle writeth that the <hi>ſtipend of ſin is death,</hi> but life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting is <hi>the gift of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> Vpon theſe words our Rhemiſts haue noted, <hi>that the ſequell of ſpeach required, that as he ſaide, death or damnation is the ſtipend of ſinne, ſo life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting is the ſtipend of iuſtice, and ſo it is.</hi> Wherein euerie man may behould their intollerable ſaucines and preſumption in ſetting the holie Apoſtle to ſchoole, in
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:27710:238"/>controling his ſpeach, in corrupting his meaning. For if the caſe had ſtood ſo clearlie and roundlie as theſe men teach, that euen as condemnation is the ſtipend of finne, ſo is eternall life the ſtipend of iuſtice, it had bene as caſie for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to haue ſo written, as to alter his wordes, and hauing ſaide that death is the wages of ſinne, to affirme after an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of ſpeach that life euerlaſting is, not the wages of iuſtice, but the gift, and free gift of God. And doutles accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ghoſt, it is no other, but proude blaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to ſaie, as the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> ſaie, that <hi>as death is the ſtipend of ſinne, ſo life euerlaſting is the ſtipend of iustice:</hi> ſeing the one ſtipend is of meere due, and deſert, the other onelie of grace and mercie: ſo that if God would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into iudgement with vs according to the rigour of his iuſtice, we could not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge euerlaſting life for any iuſtice that we had wrought, as all the ſcriptures doe moſte aboundantlie and plainelie teach. Their onelie excuſe hangeth vpon <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> whoe in a certaine epiſtle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>105.</hi>

<pb n="412" facs="tcp:27710:239"/>grace, becauſe our merites are wrought in vs by grace, not gotten by our owne habilitie:</hi> to like effecte he writeth in diuerſe other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his workes and treatiſes, as euerie one knoweth that hath bene conuerſant in reading his bookes. What then? ſhal we graunt <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> to be an author of this Popiſh and Sorbonicall doctrine of iuſtification by merite of workes? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe. The anſwere is eaſie, and no more eaſie then true, that by merites <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> vnderſtandeth good workes after the manner of ſpeach in latine, and by ſtipend or reward he meaneth that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite or gifte which God repaieth to good workes, &amp; to the workers of iuſtice. What difference then is there betweene our <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi> and <hi>Saint Auguſtine,</hi> with whome we alſo conſent? In wordes may ſeeme no difference at all: in ſubſtance and truth of doctrine as great difference, as is betweene heauen and earth, life and death, God and man. We know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe with <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> according to the doctrine of holie ſcripture, that life eternall is a reward of iuſtice and good workes, but not as death is a ſtipend of ſinne, according to the <hi>Sorboniſts and
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:27710:239"/>Rhemiſts</hi> religion. And howſoeuer <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> pleaſeth them in his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this place, the which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding being rightlie vnderſtood ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing for them, yet other fathers haue obſerued of the Apoſtles wordes ſet downe in this manner, that eternall life is onelie a gift, not deſerued, but freelie beſtowed, and that this was the cauſe whie the Apoſtle applied not the name of ſtipend to life euerlaſting, as he had done before to death. Looke vpon <hi>Origen</hi> in his commentaries vpon the fourth of the Romans, and the latter end of the ſixt. And this as it is ſound and ſincere doctrine, ſo muſt it alſo of all Chriſtians neceſſarilie be confeſſed. For he that ſinneth, hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued death worthilie, in reſpect of the ſinne committed, which is a tranſgreſſion of Gods will and commaundement: and for which without remiſſion there is no hope to eſcape eternall condemnation. But can he that worketh well, for one, or two, or moe good workes, claime vnto himſelf as a due debt, the kingdome of heauen for the ſame? For what if the Lord will examine our workes ſtraitlie according to his lawe in euerie circumſtance, our inward zeale,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:27710:240"/>loue, intention, deſire of Gods glorie, continuance and perſeuerance in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, conformitie of our will with the rule of Gods word, and ſhall finde in the worke and in the worker great infirmitie, manie wants, much imperfection, manifold ſins in the meane time, both in thought, in worde, and deed, ſhall the good workes notwithſtanding being thus tried &amp; found in them-ſelues inſufficient &amp; vnanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to gods iuſtice, and alſo hauing manie ſinnes inherent together with them in the ſame perſon, ſtand vp before the Lorde, and chalenge of right the reward of life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting in his kingdome?

               <p>The Prophet Dauid although he were a holie man, and had not onelie repented hartelie for his wicked deedes, but alſo brought forth manifold fruites of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and regeneration, yet deſireth moſte humblie of the Lord that he <hi>would not enter into iudgement with him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pſal. 143.2.</note> for ſo much as if he woulde ſo doe, neither he nor anie man liuing could eſcape condemnation. And

               <p>Yea the Romane Church it ſelfe which
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:27710:241"/>moſte of all magnifieth the merites of workes, yet being ſecretlie, and as it were vnwittingly caried away with ſway of this trueth, hath ſometimes made open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thereof, and taught all hir children to ſing an other ſong, then that which now ſo commonly is heard amongſt them of iuſtification and ſaluation through me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of their workes. For in the ſeruice that is preſcribed for the dead this praier is ſet forth to be vſed of all, and is oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, <hi>Domine quando veneris iudicare ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, vbi me abſcondam á vultu irae tuae?

So though in their life time many of them be obſtinatlie bent, and haue in their mouth nothing ſo much, as good workes, merite, rewarde, due, debt, recompenſe for their wel doing, yet the time drawing neer, when they muſt holde vp their handes at the bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yet doth euerie faithfull Chriſtian, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping as much as in him lieth the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, hope for the kingdome of heauen, aske eternall life, yea and alſo in ſome ſorte promiſe to his workes the crowne of glorie, not for merite and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of his works, but in reſpect of Gods meere mercy, whoe hath promiſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe vpon vs and our workes greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then we can poſſiblie deſerue.
